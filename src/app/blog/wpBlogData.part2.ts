You don’t believe me, right? Well, this video from Ted Talks presented here will prove to you it’s true and possible:</p>\n<p><span>Well, it’s Peekaboo!</span></p>\n<p><span>From an early age, infants and young toddlers are drawn to games like Peekaboo. It allows them to socialize with adults while also learning about the permanence of objects. Children can also practice their sense of humor and gross motor abilities while playing this game.</span></p>\n<p><span>A simple baby game of Peekaboo can be very beneficial to an infant. It gives children the fundamental skill of object permanence, which teaches them that even if they can’t see your eyes, nose, or mouth, they are still present. This classic game also teaches infants </span><a href=\"/baby-development/newborn-tips-and-facts/\"><span>how to use their arms and hands to emulate the adult in the game</span></a><span> by bringing them up to their faces.</span></p>\n<p><span>Peekaboo, an old favorite, is still one of the best baby games ever devised. Why? Peekaboo engages a baby’s senses, improves gross motor abilities, improves visual tracking, </span><a href=\"/baby-development/baby-communication-tips/\"><span>promotes social development</span></a><span>, and, most importantly, tickles her sense of humor. Peekaboo also teaches object permanence, or the idea that something exists even if she can’t see it (like your smiling face).</span></p>\n<p><span>When can a baby start playing Peekaboo? Peekaboo can be played with newborns and gets more complicated as your child gets older. At roughly 4 months of age, children grasp the notion of Object Permanence, but even a </span><a href=\"/0-3-months-baby/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>1-month-old will enjoy the eye contact</span></a><span> and parental engagement that a game of Peekaboo gives.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/baby-game-Peekaboo-with-a-baby-e1631623406211.jpg\" alt=\"baby game - Peekaboo with a baby\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<p><span>This also allows adults to do something foolish and amusing with the infant, eliciting small bursts of laughter from the child. Although there are electronic toys on the market that play Peekaboo with youngsters, as well as books and puzzles that include the same principles, the classic game requires no resources.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Advantages of a Peekaboo Baby Game: </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aISXCw0Pi94\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span>Peekaboo teaches Object Permanence in a BIG way.</span></a><span> What is the definition of Object Permanence? Humans aren’t born knowing that people, places, and things exist despite their inability to be seen, smelled, tasted, or touched. When a baby’s caregiver leaves the room, it’s one of the most common reasons for them to get unhappy or worried.</span></p>\n<p><span>This game not only teaches skills, but it also functions as an excellent “distraction” tool for newborns who are weary, grumpy, or angry. Infants will become diverted from their unhappiness and participate in if you play this game with a cheerful voice, which will often cheer them up!</span></p><p style=\"margin-top:1.5em\"><strong>Ready to support your baby’s development?</strong> <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">Explore the BabyPillars program</a>, milestone-based guidance for every stage.</p>",

    htmlContent: "<h2>What Is Gripe Water and What Is It Good For?</h2>\n<p>First thing first; What is gripe water? Gripe water is a non-prescription medication used to treat colic and other gastrointestinal disorders and discomforts in infants in various nations across the world.</p>\n<p>Gripe water is a liquid form of herbal medicine. There are various varieties, but most formulae include a combination of herbs, such as: fennel, ginger, chamomile, licorice, cinnamon and lemon balm.</p>\n<p>On any given day, a colicky baby may cry for several hours. Though the exact etiology of colic is unknown, some believe it is caused by gastrointestinal discomfort caused by gassiness.</p>\n<p>The good news is that your infant can be soothed in a variety of ways. The herbal cure known as gripe water has helped millions of parents relax restless newborns all over the world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/baby-development/newborn-tips-and-facts/\">When a baby is unable to release gas</a>, he or she is more likely to develop stomach discomfort. Some babies cry for hours, and it can keep up to even days at a time.</p>\n<p>Because the herbs in gripe water are said to help with digestion, this cure is thought to help with gassy colic. Did you know that teething discomfort and hiccups are also treated with gripe water?</p>\n<h3>Ok, Understood but When Should I Give Gripe Water to My Baby?</h3>\n<p>A baby’s primary mode of communication is crying. Nobody knows your baby’s cries like you, so <a href=\"/baby-development/baby-crying/\">you’ll be able to tell if he or she is sleepy or hungry right away</a>.</p>\n<p>Although crying is natural, your baby may cry excessively at times, even if he or she is well-fed, changed, held ets. This could be a sign of another issue, such as teething or colic.</p>\n<h3>Is Gripe Water Safe?</h3>\n<p>Although gripe water is typically harmless, it should NOT be given to <a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">babies under the age of one month</a>. At this age, the digestive tract is still developing and delicate.</p>\n<p>Gripe water comes in a variety of forms. You might be hesitant to give this supplement to your infant if you’re only accustomed with standard formulas that contain alcohol and sugar and if so do not give them to your baby.</p>\n<p>While alcohol, sugar, and artificial tastes are present in certain gripe water formulae, they are not present in all varieties. It’s critical to always utilize gripe water that’s been specially formulated for newborns. Make sure you read the package’s ingredients list. Sodium bicarbonate and peppermint are also found in some kinds of gripe water.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/gripe-water-Gripe-Water-Recommended-scaled-e1631007875252.jpg\" alt=\"Gripe Water Recommendations \" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h3>So, What Kind Should I Give My Baby? What Do You Recommended?</h3>\n<p>Instead of giving you one or two of our answer we asked our <a href=\"/courses/\">BabyPillars family members</a> what do they give their babies? Which one worked for them and which one they suggest. We got a lot of answers that were the same but also great not so common answers including DIY ones.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Products and Remedies by Moms and DIY At Home.</h3>\n<p><strong>Sara M. </strong>Our <a href=\"/courses/3-6-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">3 month old</a> loves Wellements! We typically only give him the nighttime one, but have used day and night.</p>\n<p><strong>Kim S.</strong> Original (green) and nighttime (purple) mommy’s bliss. Day time works amazing the night time definitely helps calm him down and he sleeps very well 6-7 hrs at a time only waking once a night for a bottle and is up and alert at 7-7:30 am every morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Emmily P.</strong> Make your own. Get a box of chamomile tea and a box of ginger tea and make them together. Way better deal too.</p>\n<p><strong>Tione M. </strong>We use the night time Mommy’s Bliss and it works wonders for us! Hiccups are gone within a minute of giving her the gripe water.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly T. </strong>My <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/\" title=\"AAP HealthyChildren.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pediatrician</a> doesn’t like gripe water but I swear by mylicon. My son literally farts the whole time he drinks his bottle and overall is a lot less fussy. It’s gentle enough where you can give it at every feeding too which is a plus!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa C.</strong> Currently using gas drops as needed + Gerber Soothe daily for my <a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">2 month old</a>. The gas drops seem to relieve him a little bit, but it’s so short-lived, which is why I guess we can administer up to 12 times a day.The probiotics were recommended by his pediatrician office. We have noticed less (severe) episodes of painful gas/grunting, but he def still has gas pains every now and then. Hard to tell if it’s the probiotics or just his tummy maturing. I just know his gas pains used to make ME cry , but now, they are a little more tolerable.<strong>Carolina K. </strong>My baby was VERY gassy, i tried gripe water, leg exercises, mylicon, we thought he was a colic’y baby.. he ended up having a tongue tie causing him to swallow so much air, we got that fixed &amp; he was like a new baby after a few weeks!! we also use the playtex baby bottle with the liners, you remove all the air in the bottle before feeding!</p>\n<p><strong>Tori H. </strong>If you formula feed, Enfamil Nueropro Gentlease one I switched my son on was a totally new baby, and occasionally gas drops when he gets really gassy. I swear night and day difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruby B. </strong>DIY HERE. My daughter was severely colic and it turned out it was from her holding in her gas. Plus the crying makes them suck in even more air. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ql-wB6yimOB8J8u2cvK5w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">I would do baby fart Exercises (yes no kidding) you can find them on YouTube</a>. SO much would come out every hour or so. I’d do it at every diaper change. She’s a year old now and she isn’t colic anymore (just whines) but it lasted a good <a href=\"/courses/6-9-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">6 months</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Melisa M. </strong>DIY belly massage helped the most for my girl. Sometimes warm bath submersion would work too.</p>\n<p><strong>Lori A. </strong>DIY Peddle, peddle, peddle honey. Hold your babies legs or feet and just move them in a slow peddling motion for several minutes. Do that for a couple minutes at a time and repeat if necessary. Advice I got from the nicu when my daughter was a <a href=\"/blog/premature-baby-care\">preemie</a> and there for 2 months. It does help get the gas moving.</p>\n<h3>Is it True or false? Does it help my baby?</h3>\n<p>There is little evidence that gripe water is effective, and one small study in India concerns whether drinking gripe water causes vomiting in newborns who have already shown signs of colic.</p>\n<p>Along with sodium bicarbonate and dill oil, the original mixture included alcohol and sugar. Alcohol is no longer used in products nowadays.</p>\n<p>While gripe water has not been proven to be a reliable solution for soothing colicky newborns, it is usually considered harmless. Use other relaxing tactics as well. Make an appointment with your doctor if you’ve tried various home cures and your baby’s condition hasn’t improved or worsened.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you think?

Always remember, where there is a will there is a way.</p>\n<p>Spend time with your spouse. – Talk to him; make him aware of the changes you feel &amp; how he can help you in this journey. Involve him in this entire process. Take a long drive together and spend time together every day. It’ll nourish the bond between the two of you.</p>\n<p>If it is not broken do not try to fix it. – <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/instead-of-trying-to-fix-it-for-my-kids-im-going_b_5b55f2d8e4b08c2f0a5e0fab\">Don’t try to fix everything</a>. Give young kids a chance to find their own solutions. When you lovingly acknowledge a child’s minor frustration without immediately rushing in to save him, you teach him self-reliance and resilience.</p>\n<p>Schedule special magical time together. (parenting tips from our members) – Schedule daily special times. Read storybooks to them before going to bed. As they grow, ask them how was their day at school, what did they like about the day. You can make your daily special time for your child magical.</p>\n<p>We are parenting together. – Encourage daddy/mommy times – It’s important for a child to spend time with dad and with mom apart.

After spending time apart, when you meet again, greet your child with a smile. When things are going not so great, breathe and try to think of something that makes you smile. It’s simple and yet so powerful.</p>\n<p>Gal Gadot is superwomen only in the movie. – Don’t try to be a supermom – Know your limits. Try and say no, when you think you are spreading yourself too thin. When you need help ask.</p>\n<p>Dare to be ridiculous and strange. – You want your child to have courage, joy, happiness and a desire to find meaning in life? Dare to be ridiculous: dance together, laugh, laugh and laugh some more, invent, create, play, whatever it may be, step outside your comfort zone once a day. It’s worth every moment of connection and it models amazing qualities needed for success.</p>\n<p>We are not alone. They walk among us. – Seek help – You are not alone. Take help from your mother, mother-in-law, relatives, friends. People you can trust &amp; depend on, you can let go and just breath.</p>\n<p>Parenting tips that works for you: My time is my time, your time is your time. – <a href=\"/blog/premature-baby-care/\">Aim for Balance</a> – Make time for yourself to re-energize. Our children are learning not just from what we say but so much from watching us. Striving to lead a balanced life, which includes time for ourselves really matters.

A baby is born with the ability to notice contrasts between light and dark and when we smile at our baby or approach him, he recognizes our facial features and later learns to imitate them and use them.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/newborn-tips-and-facts/\"><span>When a baby is born</span></a><span>, we can see that his smile is an involuntary smile which is created by impulses in the lower brain area. Around the age of 8-10 weeks a voluntary smile can be determined when he sees his parent or caregiver. The smile represents a pleasant reaction to the figure in front of him and expresses our baby’s satisfaction.</span></p>\n<p><span>Later you will see your baby respond to the environment by using his voice and this can be expressed in a gurgle, laughter and later in an attempt to imitate sounds he or she hears.</span></p>\n<p><span>As the environment of our baby produces more and more communication and stimulus with our baby by laughter, singing, voices etc. and while you wait for your baby to respond to these <span>baby communication </span>you will see better communication develop and your baby’s desire to respond to what is happening around him will grow and enhance day by day.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our <span>baby communication </span>connections to his environment are made through the senses, our baby looks at the face of the person in front of him, hears the sounds around him and tries to understand where the touch on his body came from and thus actually begins to get to know himself and his surroundings.</span></p>\n<p><span>The more we communicate with our baby through several senses in parallel, the more attentive he will be and better communication will develop. The more our baby’s environment provides him with </span><a href=\"/blog/rolling-over/\"><span>security through the various senses</span></a><span>, the more he will grow up to be a safer and more communicative baby.</span></p>\n<p><span>Signs that can indicate a problem or difficulty in communication include unstoppable crying and nervousness, staring into space, inability to focus his gaze and/or turning his head to the sides when attempting to make eye contact, our baby might not reach out his hands, does not smile and more. At later ages our baby or toddler might be drawn to rotating elements, hypnotized to screens, plays with himself for many hours alone, makes no sounds or verbal communication and much more.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/baby-communication-tips-Baby-Communication-Tips-for-New-Parents.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Communication Tips for New Parents\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2><span>The most important tips to enhance baby communication.</span></h2>\n<p><span><strong>Eye contact and deep touch.</strong>It is important that on various occasions during the day you will bring your baby closer to you in a position where he feels safe and where we can make direct eye contact with him for longer periods of time. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Respond to crying.</strong>It is important that the response to our baby’s crying will be a sensitive and the correct response – you will need to understand your babies cues and needs every step of his development.<a href=\"/0-3-months-baby-development-videos/tools-for-coping-with-crying/\"></a></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Baby Communication and dialog.</strong>Creating a dialogue with your baby from various distances (while waiting for his reaction) will teach your baby to communicate with those in front of him and his surroundings.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Changing postures regularly.</strong></span><a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-roll-over/\"><span>Minimize prolonged lying on the back</span></a><span>, while awake, which can lead to stress and panic in infants.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Minimize external stimuli that create restlessness and over stimuli.</strong>Minimize external stimuli that create restlessness and over stimuli for your baby so that he can learn to be attentive to his environment and create healthy eye contact and communication with those in front of him.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Do not expose your baby to screens as much as possible.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Minimize toys.</strong></span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAmp4nWZ3_w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Allow your baby to explore a human face or one toy at a time</span></a><span>.

When we help our child to walk, he does walk, but not on his own, but with our lead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/9-12-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">Walking is supposed to happen independently</a>, from experience of many years I have learned that when walking is not developing independently, it is because of the balancing system.</p>\n<p>Our baby balancing system has not yet developed properly, and therefore our baby balancing ability is not yet mature.This is due to the non-realization of some of the <a href=\"/milestone-tracker\">developmental milestones</a> that were supposed to take place from the first months of life, such as:lying on the stomach and lifting the head, <a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-roll-over/\">rollovers</a>, balance and movement between the two sides, keeping the head in the center line of the body, <a href=\"/course/provide-your-baby-confidence-in-sitting-transitioning-to-crawling/\">sitting properly</a>, standing, and more.</p>\n<p>When our baby does these processes on his own, Independently, he learns to balance himself, organize his head in the midline, use his hands and feet correctly and then stand up.From there he begins to take his first steps on his own and learns his own balance and posture.So, what do you do when your baby just “wants” to go? Just “wants” to stand up.The question here is who does the wishing come from you or your baby.</p>\n<p>I think in many cases the desire is of the parent and the interpretation is that my baby just “wants” to go.Try to pay attention to whether it is more you or your baby. You can do a lot of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IWkmBGJ9EaA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one-on-one time together</a> that will make you and your baby enjoy his development and not necessarily walking.It is also possible to occasionally lend a hand, but not to make it a routine.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/child-start-walking-child-start-walking-with-dad.jpg\" alt=\"child start walking with dad\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<p>Our job as parents is not to help or encourage our children to develop, but to create for them an environment that will stimuli their development and that will help them develop the skills they need to go through all the stages of development, and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gLIETofy3Oc\">help your child start walking</a>.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, when you give a child a hand, he trusts someone else and not himself. Therefore, I highly recommend parents to be very patient and make sure that <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rRiak7G97Sw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the first stages of development have been taken place and properly</a>, if not, repeat them through exercises and games.

It’s important for YOU, dream feeding means less time putting baby back to sleep because they never woke up so more sleep time for you.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Alison H.</strong>Dream feeding is the best! People always say get all the rest you can while you’re pregnant bc having a baby will exhaust you (just had our 3rd 3 months ago) and after the first one I realized no I am so much more rested after baby gets here and it’s pretty much because of dream feeding (and my kids love sleep!) the first couple weeks it takes a bit bc baby is new, but you and him/her will learn quickly.

For example, </span><a href=\"/blog/the-4-pillars-of-falling-asleep-faster/\"><span>baby goes to bed</span></a><span> at 8pm and mom dream feeds at 11 (feeds baby very carefully without waking baby) before she goes to bed, so baby doesn’t wake right after she gets in bed.</span></p>\n<p><span>Mine won’t dream feed and some people feel it disrupts sleep (because you risk waking a sleeping infant). I just sleep when he sleeps so I’m in my room sleeping or reading whole he sleeps from 9pm-8am. He’s in his crib all that time except 1 or maybe 2 <a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">nursing</a> sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Leslie C.</strong>Do it. Know it. Own it. Love it. You won’t regret it! I still wake up a couple times a night but waking up and getting up are two TOTALLY different things. When I can just help a little rooting mouth to the boob rather than get a whole entire creature out of her bed and to the boob, it really makes the night a lot easier and we both get better sleep for it. ?</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/dream-feeding-Dream-feeding-baby-sleep-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Dream feeding baby sleep\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Sydney T.</strong>Dream feeding has saved my LIFE especially at night and sometimes during the day when I’m not ready to wake up from our morning nap lol. I dream feed (let my daughter latch) every time she gets restless when she’s sleeping- if I don’t we’re at the point now she will sit up in bed and try to crawl around half asleep, then wake up completely even though she’s sooooo tired ?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Daniela L.</strong>I’m a FTM also and dream feeding was LIFE CHANGING for me! Basically, from my understanding or how I do it is I don’t wake up my baby when it’s her “feeding” time or wait until she wakes up, but rather she just feeds in her sleep. So, for me I sleep topless and when she’s hungry I just feel her move around until she finds my nipple and she just drinks milk until she’s back fully asleep.</span></p>\n<p><span>If I wake up and go to the bathroom or get a drink in the middle of the night, I also feed her while she’s sleeping to top her off. She doesn’t wake up once during the night since we did this around 2 months because she never wakes up hungry so sleeps with her belly full all night and I don’t have to wake up to nurse her. She just does it on her own and let’s go of my nipple when she’s done and latches on again when she wants.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Hana A.</strong>Dream feeding has been great for me! I had to cut dairy from my diet to avoid reflux. </span><a href=\"/courses/babypillars-sleep-plan/\"><span>I nurse my baby to sleep</span></a><span> and usually pat her butt or rub her head while she is nursing to help her fall asleep. We side lay nursing. As soon as baby starts stirring, I wake up and put her on the breast. </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/EzzqwmJJEfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Before she is crying</span></a><span> or even opened her eyes, she has boob and usually will fall <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/safe-sleep/\" title=\"AAP Safe Sleep Guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">back to sleep</a> after a few minutes of nursing (and usually one longer session where she nursed for a while). I have become such a light sleeper I wake up to her moving before she even makes a noise.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Kelsey H.</strong>From what I understand, baby doesn’t really wake up, just finds the boob and latches on for a bit mid sleep. You don’t really do anything, just leave your boob out. Baby does the rest.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Emma B.</strong>We used to do a dream feed at around 11pm. He was </span><a href=\"/blog/top-9-bottles-breastfeed-newborn-baby/\"><span>bottle fed</span></a><span> and I used to change his nappy and give him a bottle whilst he was still asleep, used to sit him up after the bottle and burp him and he would still be fast asleep ?Then we would go to bed.</span></p>\n<p><span>With my second I pumped and gave it to her in a bottle (latch issues). She would go down in our bed around 7 and I would go back in at 10 and give her a bottle not changing her diaper and she would sleep right through it…. I did that until she was about 6 months. I switched to formula and she was sleeping through the night by then.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Cassaundra R.</strong>Dream feeding is when you </span><a href=\"/blog/top-9-bottles-breastfeed-newborn-baby/\"><span>give baby their bottle while they’re still sleeping</span></a><span> so they stay asleep for longer. Baby should be half awake for the feed and then go right back to sleep with a full belly. We usually did our dream feeds around 11 right before I went to sleep so I could get a few hours of uninterrupted sleep ?</span></p>\n<p><span>Dream feeding is basically feeding the baby every few hours BEFORE they wake up. Once I knew my baby’s wake/hunger schedule I started dream feeding. you can Dream feed with a bottle. It’s when they’re not quite awake so with my baby he starts a little cry, but his eyes are still closed. </span><a href=\"/blog/baby-refuses-bottle/\"><span>I feed him before he wakes </span></a><span>all the way and then once he’s done eating, he’s passed back out. Sometimes you can predict what time they’re about to wake like if they wake the same time every night and do it right before.</span></p>\n<p><span>With my first I pumped and gave it to her in a bottle (latch issues).

    htmlContent: "<h1>Your baby refuses to switch to a bottle? This one is for you!</h1>\n<p>Here are ten gold tips that will lead to real change in a few days:</p>\n<p>Who doesn’t know a story of a baby who firmly refuses to move from <a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">breastfeed</a>ing to a bottle? In most cases, the difficulty of transitioning to a bottle is really created out of habit and protest rather than real and objective difficulty, although sometimes it seems that way. But your maternity leave is over, and you must get your baby to kindergarten and there is no escape. So, here are some ideas and tips:</p>\n<p>1. The bottle game. <a href=\"/blog/top-9-bottles-breastfeed-newborn-baby/\">Make the bottle a game</a>. Put it in your baby’s toy box. Make it rattle, put dry pasta inside or anything that has the effective interest (make sure of course it is sealed good). Your baby discovers and explores his or her environment through oral stimulation. It is likely he will make friends with it.</p>\n<p>2. No Fear. Approach it with ease and not with fear. A prophecy that fulfills itself is not a cliché. Rapid heart rate and shaking hands will not contribute in this situation. Look at this as it is going to happen don’t say to yourself “he will never eat from a bottle” whatever you say or even think your baby will apply.</p>\n<p>3. Imitators – <a href=\"https://youtu.be/g5qvYw-3-G0\">Infants are the imitators of life</a>. It sounds ridiculous and embarrassing but if you show him how to do it, he will imitate you. </p>\n<p>4. I am hungry! Don’t try the transformation when your baby is hungry. It’s a mistake. It’s like eating for the first time with Chop Stick when you are starving. Try doing the switch in the middle of breastfeeding.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/baby-refuses-bottle-baby-refuses-to-switch-to-a-bottle-scaled-e1628775456501.jpg\" alt=\"baby refuses to switch to a bottle\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Your baby refuses to switch to a bottle? This one is for you!</h2>\n<p>5. Pacifier stimulation. Playing and stimulating the mouth and tongue with a <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-when-your-baby-does-not-stop-sucking/\">pacifier are great for stimulating</a> and preparing the mouth for the rubber affect. Place the pacifier in your baby’s mouth and roll it in his mouth and on his tongue. Repeat this activity every day and several times a day. Here is the video how to do it.</p>\n<p>6. Try a bean bag. Place your baby in a bean bag at the time of action. Bringing your baby’s hands closer to the middle line of his body will also help the tongue to grip the bottle better.</p>\n<p>7. Daddy will do it. Is it better for dad to do it? It depends? And I find it less of a yes or no approach.</p>\n<p>8. It’s the wrong nipple. I don’t think it depends on the type of nipple. You may find that if you try 100 nipples you will find one that works better with it. But it also makes sense that if you try something else 100 times it will work too.</p>\n<p>9. Well Done 5cc. If your baby sucks only 5 cc from the bottle, that’s a great job and let him know that. How? Even with breastfeeding! I know that some will say that breastfeeding here is not appropriate – but with this action you are signaling that it is good and desirable behavior (by way of reinforcement) – it is worth sucking from a bottle because you will also have breastfeeding after.</p>\n<p>10. If he refuses to take the bottle, I would not suggest <a href=\"/blog/newborn-tips-and-facts/\">breastfeeding immediately if he is not hungry</a> (see no. 4). Take a few seconds and try again, no-go? Try next time.</p>\n<p><em><strong>We would love to hear your thoughts and comments below. What helped you? What are you struggling with?

He or she knows how to do it. believe me.</p>\n<p>15. House music and rhythmic dance is a sedative (even more than lullaby’s) Try me.</p>\n<p>16. Up to the age of three months lay your baby down for the night around 9pm.</p>\n<p>17. From the first moment, be careful not to take your baby out of his or your room at night.</p>\n<p>18. Practice floor time from the first minute.</p>\n<p>19. Practice abdominal time from the first minute.</p>\n<p>20. Let your baby be exposed to as many people, sounds and smells as possible.</p>\n<p>21. Maintain a normal noise routine at home.</p>\n<p>22. You can flush the toilet at night.</p>\n<p>23. You can also open a bag of potato chips at night.</p>\n<p>24. Don’t be tempted to look at your neighbor’s baby – he’s more developed than yours – <a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-chart-how-long-should-a-baby-really-sleep/\">he’s also a better sleeper</a>. (Also from experience, trust me).</p>\n<p>25. Going outside? Best in a carrier wrap or with a carrycot.</p>\n<p>26. Don’t use the swing for long periods of time. It is generally better in advance not to buy one.</p>\n<p>27. Do not rush to tilt the carrycot, swing or stroller.</p>\n<p>28. Sterility is an important thing – to an extent.</p>\n<p>29. Let the older siblings approach and also touch your baby gently, they are not made of porcelain. It’s really important.</p>\n<h2>Newborn tips and tricks</h2>\n<p>30. <a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">Breastfeed</a>ing is great – but there are other ways of sedation you should exposed your baby to.</p>\n<p>31. Babies relax from contact, yes that’s right. But they are mostly relaxed by a sense of security. Try to give it to them. Try the “fake it until you make it” approach.</p>\n<p>32. If you decide to wrap your baby at night – make sure that your baby can sleep without it too. At two and a half months you will need to begin to remove it completely.</p>\n<p>33. Changing a diaper at night – if necessary – do it quietly and without turning on the light and/or talking.</p>\n<p>34. Pacifier? Intelligent use! See my previous post about pacifiers.</p>\n<p>35 Transitional objects? Why not … recommended from the start.</p>\n<p>36. A small night lamp in the room? excellent.</p>\n<p>37. Your baby is not supposed to turn over/roll over before three months.</p>\n<p>38. Let your baby put his hands in his mouth. It is excellent for your baby and that’s what he or she choose.</p>\n<p>39. From the first moment think on movement and transitioning . I already said – your baby is not made of porcelain.</p>\n<p>40. When you lift your baby from the floor or lower surfaces, <a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">lift through the side</a>.</p>\n<p>41. Vertical grip is a perfect grip. You can always support your baby head with your free hand.</p>\n<p>42. Do not try to seat him or her up and do not try to make them stand – Your baby is not a toy.</p>\n<p>43. Let him try to fall asleep on his own, do not be alarmed that he is moving on his way to fall asleep. You are also moving on the way there no?</p>\n<p>44. If your baby hand is stuck under his chest – don’t rush to help him out – if you want to help, bend the leg of that side towards his stomach. This will raise his chest and allow the hand to unstuck.</p>\n<p>45. Don’t be so gentle with your baby, he will respond better to strong, clear hands.</p>\n<p>46. Dress your baby and take off clothes while inside the bean bag. He is calmer and feels safer there than on a swaddle surface.</p>\n<p>47. Don’t start feeding your baby if he cries. Let him relax first and then begin.</p>\n<p>48. Always <a href=\"/blog/baby-crying/\">respond to crying</a>. Obviously. If it takes you twenty seconds or even thirty to respond – no disaster will happen.</p>\n<p>49. Participate in an online or offline development workshop. It really enriches and contributes.</p>\n<p>50. Remember that they grow day by day. This too – enriches and contributes.</p>\n<p>Good luck and love </p>\n<p>Anat.</p>\n<p>Like it | Share it | Use it.</p><p style=\"margin-top:1.5em\"><strong>Ready to support your baby’s development?</strong> <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">Explore the BabyPillars program</a>, milestone-based guidance for every stage.</p>",

Question: Any tips on how to get a newborn to go to sleep at night?!</strong></p>\n<p>Camelia .A. Make sure to keep them up a good bit during the day. Rock them, wear them out by playing. <a href=\"/blog/tummy-time\">Tummy time</a> really works! Lavender incense calms them. And sometimes just letting them cry it out just keep giving binky.</p>\n<p>Jennifer .R. don’t sleep at night when they are one week old ?? I can laugh about it now but it was horrendous to go through at the time. There is just no schedule at this time and still have their days and nights mixed up. Just find a good tv show to watch at night and get some naps in during the day. It will get better.</p>\n<p>Annabelle .P. My baby girl loved to be swaddled when she was a newborn!</p>\n<p>Tiana .G. My <a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">baby girl is two months today</a> and her schedule is mint. I let her feed and sleep when she wants and she made her own schedule. Ale sleeps from 11:00 pm to 8 am then feeds and goes back to bed before 11 and wakes and hangs out for a while till 2 pm feeds sleeps wakes up around 6 feeds sleeps till 8 and then I bath her and keep her up till 11 sometimes 12 sometimes 1 but she sleeps all night.</p>\n<p>Taylor .P. My girl is 2 1/2 months and she doesn’t even has a schedule. She eats and sleeps when she wants.</p>\n<p>Sarah .K. She is going to be on a whacky schedule for a short bit, but she’ll start to figure out days and nights are different. Try establishing a night time routine now, even though she probably won’t stay asleep it’s good to start establishing a clear indication of bedtime. With my daughter I turn all the lights off, change her diaper, give her a bottle, turn on her Relax Melodies mix and rock her until she’s asleep. Sometimes I speed hours picking her up and rocking her again until she’s really asleep, sometimes she falls asleep before I even get started on the routine… Point is, it’s going to be a while before you have a defined “go to bed and slept” routine.</p>\n<p>Also, keep in mind if she’s NOT waking up to feed at night at 1 week old you NEED to be waking her up to feed. She’ll starve… She’s too little to go for too long without a feeding. My daughter is almost 10 weeks and she goes to bed at 7pm, wakes up at 11pm, 4am to feed. (That’s why I’m posting this at 4:30am lol) Some nights when she’s in a <a href=\"/blog/infant-growth-spurts-the-ultimate-guide\">growth spurt</a> she’ll wake every 2hrs to feed.</p>\n<p>It’s just life now. Dont fear though. Sleep will return. For now feed her as much as you can, you want her to grow grow grow! The beginning is the hardest.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/baby-sleep-questions-and-answers-baby-sleep-questions-and-more-scaled-e1628777369943.jpg\" alt=\"baby sleep questions and more\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>More baby sleep questions and answers</h2>\n<p>Jessica T. Swaddle and cuddles, paci if you use one, warm bath, baby massage, chamomile, diffuse lavendar but only for 10-15 mins and make sure you dilute it. Babies shouldn’t cry it out as newborns. They do not have the capability to self soothe as infants. Remember, baby went from being in your warm and cozy tummy to a big scary world with new sounds and sights. My LO is almost 9 weeks and we do a bed time “routine” of a warm bath and massage, bottle, fresh diaper, snug swaddle. He has no routine but we try and be consistent at least. Good luck! ??</p>\n<p>Rhiannon .J. I had a bassinet mine slept in at night. After a couple of months i started put her in the cot during day for naps so she got used to it.</p>\n<p>Shes now <a href=\"/blog/5-steps-for-a-better-quitter-night-sleep/\">5months and sleeps in her cot</a> full time which is at the other end of our house ?I also have one of my partylite scentglo warmers in there to act as a nightlight for her ?</p>\n<p>Gemma .R. I made my son stay awake longer during the day and woke him up when I was ready for bed to play or change bath feed and soon as he was ready to sleep I put him down I found after a week or so he was sleeping threw the night but still having sleeps during the day I just woke him up after 4 hrs in one stint instaid of constant broken sleeps he would eventually go from 8-9pm to 5-6am then 11am to 1-2 pm.</p>\n<p>Tanee’se .C. I think they are ready in their own time, my daughter(11 weeks) has just started sleeping in her cot. I just put her in the randomly one night last week and she has slept in it (at night ever since), she still sleeps the same.. Waking ever 4-5 hours. We are still yet to get her to sleep in there during the day as she only wants cuddles, be in her carseat on car rides or be in her bouncer on vibrate.. I believe though if it becomes a problem for you/her being too big for bassinet etc. after 3m+ try the cry it out method(5mins cry, 5 mins cuddle, and repeat until it works). Good luck mumma, you got this!</p>\n<p>Silma .G. Asked: Has anyone tried the <a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-chart-how-long-should-a-baby-really-sleep/\">sleep drops for babies</a>? Did they help at all? Nothing seems to settle him down and im burning out. Hubby gets frustrated with the crying all night.</p>\n<p>Cindy .R. We tried the drops but no luck; Try magnesium cream for babies we find that works great.</p>\n<p>Nicole .S. Tried the sleep drops on miss 4 . For the 2 weeks we used them she would be awake till around 10 stopped using the drops and she’s went back to being asleep by 8.</p>\n<p>Caitlin .Platz. I found they settled my son, but didn’t help with the multiple wake ups so stopped spending money on it. I’ve just bought that magnesium cream that’s mentioned above and have tried it for the first time tonight on my now 2 year old and he fell asleep so fast tonight, don’t know if it was a coincidence, but here’s hoping ?</p>\n<p>Gaynor .H. Sleep drops didn’t work for us.</p>\n<p>Anne .C. Had the opposite effect on mine. Talk about bouncing off the wall not fun at all.</p>\n<p>Jayy .K. I’ve just started my 11 month old on some and she seems more settled having solid day nap now and wakes a couple times a night but a few extra drops and a pat on her bottom and she’s out again with out the crying.</p>\n<p>Sarah .W. Sleep drops never worked on my son I tried using kids calm and that seemed to calm him down that he slept.</p>\n<p>Kelsi .S. Perawiti Theres a body lotion from lush called sleepy i use it most nights on myself and kids, it helped my 7year old stop tossing around and chilled my very active 2year old out.</p>\n<p>Tj .S. tell him to f*** s*** it up it’s all part of been a dad.</p>\n<p>Rhi .S. Interesting to see how some people have said it’s had the opposite effect! I’ve been using them on my baby for just over a week and I swear he’s sleeping worse! And the first night he was awake for 2.5 hours in the middle of the night ?. I’m still using them because I said I’d give them a good go but maybe I’ll have a look at that magnesium cream too.</p>\n<p>Collette .B. I recommend colic calm – it helps relieve a lot of different things, such as bloating, wind, irritability, etc. it’s natural and very gentle. Always worked so well for both my two and helped them sleep so well. Very calming for them. Couldn’t recommend it enough ???</p>\n<p>Stacey .K. I’ve started using essential oils with my kids (10mo/7mo corrected twins and 2yr old). Sleep drops hyped my boy up. My premmie twins I’m reluctant to have them ingest anything that I don’t know all the ingredients/or ok’d by paediatrician. I make up a nighttime blend diffusing in their rooms and have gone from no one sleeping through to 2/3 and reduced night wakes by 10-12 times (between all of them) to 2 (for my most medically fragile babe). Been a bloody godsend!</p>\n<p>Amie .S. You need to work out what the issue is,not mask it with drops.</p>\n<p>Lucinda .T. My new baby has reflux. The best things we have discovered (she is 3 months now) are probiotics and white noise. She is on omeprazole to try and stop the projectile vomiting which stopped the burn and lessened the extreme gushing. If you go the medication route make sure it is a brand name (Losec or Dr Reddy’s) because there is a proven 30% difference in effectiveness.The probiotic has helped her tummy a lot. Instead of the constant poop she goes once a day now. I still can’t get her to sleep properly in her cot but in the Ergo carrier she will sleep for 3 hours happily in the middle of the day. During the night <a href=\"/courses/babypillars-sleep-plan/\">I start her in her cot and then for the rest of the night we co sleep in her room</a>. The way the whole household gets sleep.</p>\n<p>Michelle .B. No, unfortunately they didnt work at all.Someone said that they only work if you “place your trust in it more and have a more open mind”….It emptied my wallet, but it did.</p>\n<p><strong>Rachelle .G. Question: Opinions and thought on the “cry it out” method for babies?</strong></p>\n<p>Heather .B. 6 months is when I started. Never more than 10 minutes. Alot of times my daughter cries for attention or just because she doesn’t want to go to sleep. I was on the fence about it at first. Heard both sides. Ultimately I kade the decision I thought was best for my daughter. As of today she is 15 months old sleeps in her own room in her own crib and tells me “nigh nigh” when she is ready for bed. Most nights besides when <a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-start-teething/\">she is teething she sleeps 12 hours</a>. I make sure ALL her needs are met. Fed, clean, burped, warm and has a pacifier if those things are done I will let her cry for up to 10 mins. I know the difference in her cries though. She has her “somethings wrong” cry and her “I just want attention and to be heard” cry. I will always go to her immediately for her somethings wrong. I also have video monitors in her room so I can see her and what she is doing.</p>\n<p>Amy .R. I never did it. I researched it and found it wasn’t good for them. Plus my daughter has always cried for a reason and she’s 1 year. I was told if she’s fed and changed ignore it. One night she was crying for whqt seemed like no reason turned out her mouth hurt. That’s when I realized CIO just wasn’t for us. Cause if I hadn’t sat up with her she’d been crying in pain and I wouldn’t have know it.</p>\n<p>Bree .P. I started at 4-5 months. Id let her cry after her needs were met and if she was uncontrollably crying id calm her and start the process over again. Took about a week to get down.</p>\n<p>Caitlin .K. I won’t start letting my daughter actually CIO until about 9 months or so, after I’ve done everything to calm her, or make sure she’s okay. For now, 5-10 minutes of crying on her own, in my opinion is okay, if I rush to her, she’ll expect me to always rush right to her . I also know when my daughter is crying, and when she’s fussing.</p>\n<p>Alyssa .D. I wouldn’t use the cry it out method. Studies are showing it has the potential to cause permanent negative changes in the baby’s brain chemistry. Babies need to be loved and held. They are not crying to manipulate. They just want comfort, food and security!</p>\n<p>Stephanie .H. No , I personally could never let my son lay there and howl for me and just not respond to him. That baby needs his momma. I carry my son, everywhere. Its exhausting at it sucks sometimes but he’s just the sweetest little thing when hes cooing and spitting all over my shoulder haha.You’re their whole world, the safest thing in their whole lives, you cant just ignore that Kirsty .S. CRY IT OUT (CIO): 10 REASONS WHY IT IS NOT FOR US</p>\n<p>Cry it out can cause harmful changes to babies’ brainsCry it out can result in decreased intellectual, emotional and social developmentCry it out can result in a detached babyCry it out is harmful to the parent-child relationshipCry it out can make children insecureCry it out often doesn’t work at allEven if cry it out does “work”, parents often have to do it over and over againCry it out is disrespectful of my child’s needsDeep sleep from cry it out is often a result of traumaOur World Needs More Love</p>\n<p>Nikki .S. I wouldn’t. Here in the UK we are told all through pregnancy that comfort, closeness and soothing boosts babies <a href=\"/blog/babybraindevelopment\">brain development</a> and help them in so many ways. I could never let my little guy cry it out, if he needs his mummy snuggles to fall asleep to then that’s what he can have </p>\n<p>Cortney .A. My son is 13 months old and I let him cryout once for about 2 minutes it was horrendous I felt as upset as him!! I just feel like if they want their mum and it settles them then why stop that that’s what we are here for , they aren’t babies for long. ?</p>\n<p>Teagan .J. I’m currently <a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-training-and-baby-sleep-schedule/\">sleep training my 2 yo at night</a> because he still struggles to put himself to sleep.<a href=\"/sleepless-to-sound-sleep-ebook\">Sleep training</a> shouldn’t begin before 4 months of age, but after that there is no evidence of it causing harm. There are methods that involve more or less crying, depending on what you are comfortable with. I’m hoping no 2 is going to be better with sleep but I’m also going to avoid creating the same awful sleep habits I did with my first.</p>\n<p>Danielle .P. With limits… hun everyone is different every mother knows the difference of their babies cries.. I personally can’t go over 2 mins without going in.. but I don’t do it anymore as everything changed when my babes got sick so it’s just snuggles til they fall asleep then they go to bed…</p>\n<p>Carol-Anne .O. i use to let my daughter cry it out till she screamed.i needed housework to be done and in summer it got too hot.i did it little time to let her cry. 2 mins first go. 5 mins afterwards then she just lays down and sleep. still cries but when tired, you can’t do anything else. she’s safe till she works herself up. i started at 4 months.</p>\n<p>Brooke .K. I went to a sleep school in Brisbane with <a href=\"/blog/5-steps-for-a-better-quitter-night-sleep/\">my oldest cause he wouldn’t sleep for more than 20 minutes</a>. The method they use is to let them cry but by listening to the cry. If it’s just them whinging, you leave them. Once they start to become distressed you go in and calm them down by patting or rubbing them. No picking them up or talking to them and try to avoid too much eye contact so they don’t suddenly think it’s play time. Once they are quiet you leave the room and repeat the process until they fall asleep. We were at the school for three days and by the time we left my son went from 20 minute sleeps to sleeping through the night and having nearly 2 hr day sleeps.</p>\n<p>Jessica .D. My mum and husband tried to get me to do the cry it out method. It wasn’t for me or our son.They’re only little once and I enjoyed my snuggles during the day. He’s 2 now and doesn’t sleep with me unless he’s sick. They grow up so fast don’t feel pressured into doing anything you’re not comfortable with.</p>\n<p>Chloe .J. I do CIO but only as a last resort when my son won’t go down gently or any other way usually when he’s overtired. I do itbecause it works! I’ll take 20 minutes of crying over 2 hours of patting/rocking/shushing any day.</p>\n<p>Brianna .R. I set a timer for 20 minutes and listen and watch from the other room via baby monitor so I know exactly what he’s doing. The first 2 nights were the hardest but he was never able to get a good deep sleep while being held and I work full time so itwas draining me. Now after his bed time routine I’ll rock him and read a book till he starts rubbing his eyes than bottle to bed, he may whine a little but as soon as the door is closed he lays down and sleeps.</p>\n<p>Sharon .D. I was stuck with a bub who didn’t nap unless she was on me, so I started baby wearing. I have used the cry it out method and it still makes me very very anxious, but I assure her that when she wakes from her nap she can play and see daddy and we can do fun things like paint and stuff. She’s 2 now, but I still wear her on bad days x.</p>\n<p>Alexandria .N. I would let him fuss, but any screaming would need to be tended to. Babies of 5 months don’t understand that you are trying to teach him. All they see is “mom has always been here at bedtime and now she’s ignoring my cries”it will be confusing and exhausting</p>\n<p>Ayme .G. It works as long as you dont leave them til they’ve overwhelmed/worked up. ?thats just distressing for everyone involved.</p>\n<p>Corinda .W. No, I tried with my first and couldn’t do it for more than a minute so he figured his own routine and my second when I finished <a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">breastfeed</a>ing and she got comfortable with the bottle I put her into bed with her bottle and her dummy and she just went to sleep, if she cries I give her a cuddle and put her back down with her dummy in her mouth and she is fine. My personal opinion letting them cry causes unnecessary distress for both parent and baby. Now both my kids age 6 and 19months both go to bed at 7pm and sleep all night no hassle not make mine sleep at all… maybe it was because my mind wasn’t open lol.</p>\n<p><strong>Sara .G. Question: Day sleeps… What age did you go from two sleeps to one sleep? What time do you put them down and how long do they sleep for? DD is 13 months and is resisting her second sleep at daycare. She’s been doing this for maybe a week. Before that she was fine. Is it time to change her sleep times? On a side note… She’s almost walking, taking more steps each day. I wonder if this <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/index.html\" title=\"CDC Milestone Checklist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">developmental milestone</a> is impacting on her day sleeps and she’ll come right once fully walking. Thanks ?</strong></p>\n<p>Tracey .B. Yeah that’s around the age they drop a nap.</p>\n<p>Cheryl .J. Have you tried making the morning nap shorter – 20-30 min and then a longer second nap? We did this and then gradually dropped the morning nap going to one nap only at 12pm by 15.5 months.</p>\n<p>Deanna .E. My daughter has just turned 17 months and dropped a nap at 13 months. She has already gone a few days with no naps ?? not sure about the walking as my daughter was walking at 10 months and was still having two naps then.</p>\n<p>Hayley .M. My boys both dropped to one nap at 11 months ?</p>\n<p>Caitlan .C. 11 months both naps just weren’t going well so down to one nap at 12pm and sleeps for 2-2.5 hours so much better. Falls asleep in seconds at night too.</p>\n<p>Anneke .B. I switched at 1yr and started putting them down between 11 &amp; 11.30 and they slept up to 2 hours.</p>\n<p>Sarah .F. Around 13-14 months my LO dropped down to 1 nap. Was a bit of an adjustment and at times his nap was only 60-90 minutes long, but he is now 23 months and has a good solid 3 hour nap every afternoon around 1pm.</p>\n<p>Amanda .M. When they got to hard to get to sleep in the day, I just put them down for one at about 11 for about two hours till they start resisting that one also.</p>\n<p>Claire .H. There is a <a href=\"/blog/secrets-baby-sleep\">sleep regression</a> around 12 months which can make it harder to settle them for both naps. If you can persist until 15 months with two naps that’s awesome. My son is 15 months, we dropped the morning nap around 13 months but actually he still has a morning nap every few days because he still needs it. I wish I’d persevere with the two naps for longer.</p>\n<p>Sinead .F. Day sleeps stopped at around 15 months, he wakes in the morning at 7am, naps for 2 hours at 11:30am and goes down to bed at 7:30pm. This totally works for us and the grumps have stopped.</p>\n<p>Amber .Y. My 28 month old daughter still has 2 day sleeps ? but both my Bestie who is an early childcare teacher and my daughters experienced home based carer say this is unusual for this age.Daughter sleeps through the night so I am not in any hurry to drop the naps if she willingly settles down for them and is a good sleeper. She’ll signal to me when she’s ready.I do recall that sleep regression around age 1 though where she did resist it. I still keep the routine the same and persevere for a couple weeks, just giving her the opportunity and she took to it again.</p>\n<p>Alle .R. Around 12 months is average for dropping to one sleep (as in some do it at 10 months and others by 18 months). Sounds like she’s ready to, though every few days she might need a second nap during that transition.</p>\n<p><strong>Ashley .N. Question: How did you survive the 4 month sleep regression? LO is 3 months old and is now waking up every 1-2 hours at night again. I want to bash my head into a wall- this is miserable!</strong></p>\n<p>Heather .P. I feel you. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W64ENW9dX8s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">My little turned 4 months yesterday</a> &amp; has been doing this every night for a while now. He was sleeping through the night just long enough to spoil me &amp; now he goes to bed late, wakes up early &amp; sometimes is so hard to get <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/safe-sleep/\" title=\"AAP Safe Sleep Guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">back to sleep</a>. Then by time I pump &amp; go back to sleep he’s up like an hour later. It’s why I’m awake right now…</p>\n<p>Erica .P. If you are breastfeeding get some formula and give LO 2oz in a bottle. They may not drink it all but it will help top off their belly and help them sleep long. LO is probably going through another growth spurt. If you do just formula already, just do a thicker formula to water ratio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg-4t6XMCMk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">My almost 4 month old</a> (on the 30th) was born <a href=\"/blog/premature-baby-care\">premie</a>, and about once a month for a day or twonat a time goes through wantimg to eat more oz &amp; more often than usual. My son has to do soy formula (dairy allergy) so it’s a bit easier since I dont pump, but hang in there ladies. When I was pumping for him (when he was in the hospital) he was on a every 2hr schedule and I had to pump for 3 weeks every 2 hrs to meet his food demands and we still had to supplement formula bcuz I didn’t now enough. It sucked switching to formula only after bring him home from the NICU(made me feel like a crappy mom) but got over the bad feelings and realized <a href=\"/blog/dream-feeding/\">with his feeding demands his and my sleep life got a lot more regular and longer</a> stretches of time doing formula. Good luck. I’m told things are suppose to get a bit easier in the months to come. Plus at 6 months we can start with baby food to help feel up their belly’s!!</p>\n<p>Nicole .D.

I’d talk to them for a few minutes then tell them it’s time for bed. I’d put them back in their crib and I could hear them on the monitor rolling and making noises. Pretty soon they would fall asleep. The first few sleep.regressions wasn’t bad until my daughter turned 2. That was a nightmare. It seemed to last forever.</p>\n<p>Chardonnay .O.

    htmlContent: "<h1>The 5 Steps For A Better And Quitter Night Sleep</h1>\n<h2>The first step – Create permanent anchors.</h2>\n<p>Each one of us was born and raised in a particular environment, where there was a certain order.</p>\n<p>We knew there was breakfast, lunch, dinner, when to play and when to go to sleep. Our parents dictated our daily routine and built a certain routine for us.</p>\n<p>Years passed, we grew up and matured, the world changed and together with it our day to day life and our routine. Each one from this stage dictates to what and when he does things. Now we let ourselves go to bed late and whenever we feel tired, get up when we need or not at all, eat whenever we feel like, and yet, our lack of routines are still routines.</p>\n<p>But now we are parents, some of us build special routines for our <a href=\"/0-3-months-baby\">newborn baby</a> but some of us a lot of us go with the “routine” we have already set when there wasn’t a little bundle of joy in our home. Here is the problem! This routine doesn’t work for our baby and soon we will need to change it – To his/her routine.</p>\n<p><strong>How to organize a regular schedule for your baby?</strong></p>\n<p>Try to organize the day so that it has fixed anchors at regular times. For example: meals, playing times, going out for errands or just walking around the neighbourhood, all these “tasks” should be fixed and on regular times throughout the day.</p>\n<p>The daily routine and road signs will give your baby a sense of security and will make it easier for him/her to follow the course of the day and help organize his/her day without they will even notice.</p>\n<p><strong>Important!!!</strong><a href=\"/courses/babypillars-sleep-plan/\">It is very important that during the day your baby sleeps in his/her bed</a> so that they will learn that there is one fixed place and bed which they sleep in and have all the proper conditions for it.</p>\n<h2>The second step – The Sleeping Ceremony</h2>\n<p>The sleeping ceremony is of great importance, and it is designed to help your baby get a clear separation between day time and night time. We aim to lower our hectic life before going to bed and preparing our baby for a quality and pleasant sleep.</p>\n<p>It is important that the order of things in the ceremony will be consistent and more or less at the same sequence and time. It is important to emphasize that the ceremony must repeat itself every day, and exactly the same.</p>\n<p>During the sleeping ceremony you can put some calm music in the background, you can leave the light on, and it is important that the sleeping ceremony will have content and meaning. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgibO6Vc344\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can read a bedtime story, massage your baby for a few seconds, say good night to every large toy in the room etc</a>.</p>\n<p>Then when your done turn off the light or the music and put your baby down to sleep.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/5-steps-for-a-better-quitter-night-sleep-rolling-over-baby-to-side-scaled-e1628767562991.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Night Sleep\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>The third step – Identify signs of fatigue for a full night sleep</h2>\n<p>It is very important to recognize the signs of your baby fatigue and respond to them from the moment you recognize them and no longer than 30 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Common signs are of fatigue are:</strong></p>\n<p>Your baby rubbing their eyes.</p>\n<p>Scratching their ear or head.</p>\n<p>yawning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/course/baby-sleep-techniques/\">Another sign that you can recognize if your baby is tired is his hyperactivity</a>. Here I remember the myth most of us heard from our surroundings that you need to wait until he or she gets tired and then they will sleep for a whole night or at least A few good hours. When I tried to do this, the dream of a good night sleep just smashed into my face.When you know that your baby is long overdue and past his/her sleeping hour and he or she does not look tired at all, this is a red light you should notice.</p>\n<p>His body is over-tired and excreted adrenaline which causes your baby to enter the hyperactivity state and in such a situation it is very difficult to soothe and lay them down to sleep. And even when you’ve succeeded in putting them down, chances are they’ll wake up at night and not once but multiple times. So, avoid getting into over-fatigue and always remember that early response will ease your child’s process of falling asleep and will benefit his/her sleep quality.</p>\n<h2>The fourth step – Day and night sleep cycles</h2>\n<p>One thing that changed my understanding of my baby sleeping patterns was understanding what sleeping cycles are. A baby’s sleep cycle takes about an hour and is divided into two parts.</p>\n<p>In the first part your baby sees a dream, so you can see that when he moves a lot during sleep, blinking (REM) and it almost looks like he doesn’t sleep at all.</p>\n<p>In the second part of the <a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-chart-how-long-should-a-baby-really-sleep/\">sleep cycle, your baby enters his/her deep sleep phase</a>, where you will see and feel regular breathing, relaxed body and see that your baby sleeps just “like a baby”. After an hour or so, the sleep cycle is renewed and again your baby enters the dream phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Day Sleeping</strong></p>\n<p>Sleeping during and the amount of sleep is heavily depending on your baby age. See table above. If your baby is sleeping an entire sleep cycle, that is, an hour and more, then he or she decides to wakes up, there is no reason to bring him <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/safe-sleep/\" title=\"AAP Safe Sleep Guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">back to sleep</a>, the physical system is refreshes and this is the time he or she can get up and continue the day.</p>\n<p>During the noon sleep time your baby should not sleep more than 3 hours in total, otherwise it may turn into almost “night sleep” and it can and would change the routine and night time sleep.</p>\n<p>Your baby should sleep no less than 55 minutes (preferably an hour) at noon, otherwise, it is likely that your baby will arrive at the sleeping ceremony overly tired grumpy and the night sleep will be effected.</p>\n<p><strong>Night Sleeping</strong></p>\n<p>Even during the night, the sleep cycle is the same sleep cycle, the only thing that should change is our attitude and the way we approach our baby.</p>\n<p>When your baby wakes up in the middle of the night, your goal is to get him/her back to sleep. When your baby wakes up, it is important not to start playing with him or her and to not incorporate any other factors that will distract your baby from sleeping, otherwise he or she simply would not want to go back to sleep.</p>\n<h2>The fifth step – Good Morning – It’s a new day.</h2>\n<p>So as not to cause confusion in your baby when the night ends and a new day begins, here, too, <a href=\"/blog/5-steps-for-a-better-quitter-night-sleep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it is important to do a short sleep ceremony</a>. You can open the blinds, say good morning to the toys in the room, change the PJ’s etc.</p>\n<p>And always – start the day with a smile. It is very important that it morning and a new day has begun – Your baby should understand that too. Enter the room with a smile (even if you did not sleep at all that night), hug him or her say good Morning it’s a new and exciting day ahead.</p>\n<p>But if you know that it is not yet time to start the day, then return your baby to sleep until morning.</p>\n<p>It is important that you as the parent be decisive, very clear and confident in yourself and in your parenting. This is how your baby will learn he has someone he can trust and trust is related to every area of his or her life, not only to sleep, otherwise he or she will simply not understand what you will want from them at the next night.</p><p style=\"margin-top:1.5em\"><strong>Ready to support your baby’s development?</strong> <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">Explore the BabyPillars program</a>, milestone-based guidance for every stage.</p>",

While newborns babies sleep the majority of time, their sleep is in very short segments. As your baby grows, the total amount of sleep hours gradually decreases by age, but on the other hand the length of night sleep increases more and more each year.</p>\n<p>In general, and not for every mom, newborns daytime sleep is between 8 to 9 hours. Nighttime sleep is about 8 hours, but unfortunately newborns may not sleep more than an hour to two hours at a stretch. So when does a baby sleep through the night?</p>\n<p>Here is the answer: <a href=\"/blog/your-personal-baby-sleep-guide/\">Some babies will sleep through the night</a> (6 to 8 hours stretch) without waking starting at around 3 months of age. About 60% of babies are able to sleep through the night on a regular basis by the age of 6 to 8 months.The following <a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-chart-understanding-your-babys-sleep-patterns\">baby sleep chart</a> are the usual nighttime and daytime sleep needs for newborns through age 2 years old:</p>\n<p><strong><strong><span>Baby sleep chart by – </span></strong>Age ~ Total sleep hours ~ Total hours of nighttime sleep ~ Total hours of daytime sleep</strong></p>\n<p>Newborn ~ 16 hours ~ 8-9 hours ~ 8 hours</p>\n<p>1 month ~ 15.5 hours ~ 8-9 hours ~ 7 hours</p>\n<p>3 months ~ 15 hours ~ 9-10 hours ~ 4-5 hours</p>\n<p>6 months ~ 14 hours ~ 10 hours ~ 4 hours</p>\n<p>9 months ~ 14 hours ~ 11 hours ~ 3 hours</p>\n<p>1 Year ~ 14 hours ~ 11 hours ~ 3 hours</p>\n<p>1.5 Years ~ 13.5 hours ~ 11 hours ~ 2.5 hours</p>\n<p>2 Years ~ 13 hours ~ 11 hours</p>\n<h2>Sleep Schedule</h2>\n<p>Here are the most common sleep schedules you can give your baby by his/her age, but please take in consideration your baby’s individual needs, and want’s this is not for all babies out there.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/baby-sleep-chart-how-long-should-a-baby-really-sleep-Baby-Sleep-Chart-for-you-e1628778849770.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Sleep Chart\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Day Baby Sleep Schedule</h2>\n<p><strong><span>Baby sleep chart by – Age ~ No. of Naps ~ Nap Spacing ~ Day Sleep Notes ~ Approx Total Day Sleep</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>0 – 4 Months ~ On Demand (usually 4-5) ~ 45-120 mins awake time between naps.

Avoid over tiredness and long stretches of wakefulness. Don’t be afraid to soothe your baby – s/he needs sleep! Single sleep cycle naps (3045 mins) are common in the second half of this phase. ~ Many babies will sleep 15-16 hours in 24 hours during first 2-3 months, then decreases to more like 14-15 hours +/- by 3-4 months.</span></p>\n<p><span>4 – 6 Months ~ 4 down to 3 ~ 4 months – single sleep cycle (30-45 mins naps) are still normal. By 5-6 months, babies are capable of lengthening naps. 2-2 ½ hours awake time between naps. On 3 nap pattern, third nap is shortest (30-45 mins). ~ Schedule is emerging. Prioritise your baby’s naps, paying attention to sleep location and environment now.

But, honestly, the moment they are the sweetest, and I hope you will not say a bad word about my motherhood, is when they fall asleep at night. How relaxing. How idyllic. And in order to reach the desired moment, in which they are covered in their beds and immersed in a sweet dream, I am willing to do everything.</p>\n<p \"=\"\" just=\"\" go=\"\" to=\"\" sleep…=\"\" please.=\"\" pp=\"\">Why is it really hard for babies and children to fall asleep? Michel Dowson, a clinical and medical psychologist and chief psychologist at the ST Children’s Development Center, has three main reasons: The biological cause – When a baby is born he/she still does not distinguish between day and night and we as parents need to help them acquire regular sleeping habits; The emotional reason – children suffer from fear and anxiety and therefore have trouble falling asleep and reject sleep as much as possible, and the developmental reason that characterises some of the older children, for whom <a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-struggles/\">sleep is an expression of power struggles with parents</a>.</p>\n<p \"=\"\" so=\"\" how=\"\" do=\"\" you=\"\" overcome=\"\" the=\"\" difficulties=\"\" of=\"\" falling=\"\" asleep?=\"\" dowson=\"\" explains=\"\" that=\"\" most=\"\" babies=\"\" feel=\"\" atmosphere=\"\" at=\"\" home=\"\" and=\"\" get=\"\" used=\"\" to=\"\" it.=\"\" in=\"\" same=\"\" way,=\"\" baby=\"\" feels=\"\" whole=\"\" family=\"\" is=\"\" preparing=\"\" for=\"\" sleep,=\"\" night=\"\" coming=\"\" down=\"\" it=\"\" time=\"\" sleep.=\"\" by=\"\" end=\"\" their=\"\" first=\"\" year=\"\" life,=\"\" acquire=\"\" biological=\"\" tendency=\"\" understand=\"\" sleep=\"\" time.=\"\" course=\"\" there=\"\" are=\"\" who=\"\" need=\"\" more=\"\" differences=\"\" between=\"\" day=\"\" night,=\"\" we=\"\" not=\"\" expect=\"\" behaviour=\"\" from=\"\" all.=\"\" pp=\"\">“The sleep cycle is indeed a biological thing,” says Dowson, “but it was also acquired and studied. It is very important to help the baby adjust to family sleeping habits and, more importantly, to let him learn to fall asleep alone with as little intervention as possible by parents. We do it naturally; in the day we act with the baby alertly – provoking him with games, talking loudly, arousing his attention, and conversely in the evening we lower our voices, speak calmly and darken the room. The baby, on the other hand, picks up these messages, thus acquiring the distinction between day and night.</p>\n<p \"=\"\" \"in=\"\" time,=\"\" the=\"\" baby=\"\" should=\"\" be=\"\" accustomed=\"\" to=\"\" regular=\"\" sleeping=\"\" rituals=\"\" that=\"\" bring=\"\" him=\"\" even=\"\" more=\"\" into=\"\" atmosphere=\"\" of=\"\" sleep=\"\" and=\"\" absorb=\"\" message=\"\" -=\"\" go=\"\" bed,\"=\"\" notes=\"\" dowson.=\"\" \"ritual\"=\"\" accepted=\"\" by=\"\" most=\"\" families=\"\" is:=\"\" eating=\"\" because=\"\" it=\"\" is=\"\" known=\"\" those=\"\" who=\"\" are=\"\" full=\"\" better,=\"\" bathing=\"\" no=\"\" matter=\"\" whether=\"\" a=\"\" bath=\"\" or=\"\" partial=\"\" wash=\"\" face=\"\" hands=\"\" only=\"\" brushing=\"\" teeth=\"\" environment=\"\" such=\"\" as=\"\" turning=\"\" off=\"\" lights,=\"\" lowering=\"\" sound=\"\" (in=\"\" speech=\"\" on=\"\" television)=\"\" which=\"\" helps=\"\" make=\"\" difference=\"\" between=\"\" day=\"\" night.=\"\" for=\"\" toddlers=\"\" children,=\"\" reading=\"\" story=\"\" will=\"\" also=\"\" appropriate=\"\" this=\"\" stage.=\"\" pp=\"\"><a href=\"/blog/the-4-pillars-of-falling-asleep-faster/\">The sleep ceremony varies from family to family</a>, but its components are more or less common to all families with children of different ages. But what about bedtime? It is changing from child to child and from parent to parent. There are parents that are very strict with evening hours and they are very important to them and they want more free, quite time for themselves, while there are others who needs more time with their babies at night.</p>\n<p 8=\"\" \"=\"\" \"it's=\"\" important=\"\" to=\"\" be=\"\" realistic,\"=\"\" stresses=\"\" dowson.=\"\" \"if=\"\" a=\"\" year=\"\" ago=\"\" your=\"\" seven-year-old=\"\" son=\"\" fell=\"\" asleep=\"\" at=\"\" pm=\"\" and=\"\" today=\"\" he=\"\" cannot=\"\" fall=\"\" before=\"\" nine=\"\" -=\"\" consider=\"\" that.=\"\" the=\"\" younger=\"\" siblings=\"\" should=\"\" also=\"\" realise=\"\" that=\"\" older=\"\" one=\"\" needs=\"\" less=\"\" sleep.=\"\" in=\"\" addition,=\"\" if=\"\" child=\"\" sleeps=\"\" an=\"\" afternoon=\"\" night=\"\" is=\"\" having=\"\" trouble=\"\" sleeping,=\"\" you=\"\" may=\"\" want=\"\" giving=\"\" up=\"\" nap.=\"\" any=\"\" case,=\"\" it=\"\" remember=\"\" there=\"\" are=\"\" no=\"\" clear=\"\" rules=\"\" on=\"\" this=\"\" issue,=\"\" hours=\"\" vary=\"\" between=\"\" families=\"\" children.\"=\"\" p=\"\" divdivspanimg=\"\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Baby Sleep Training for Parents\" width=\"940\" title=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Baby-Sleep-Training-1-e1628845256118.jpg\" span=\"\" divdivh2=\"\" how=\"\" do=\"\" help=\"\" baby=\"\" his=\"\" own?=\"\" h2p=\"\" dowson:=\"\" \"first=\"\" of=\"\" all,=\"\" identify=\"\" baby's=\"\" first=\"\" signs=\"\" fatigue=\"\" put=\"\" them=\"\" their=\"\" bed.=\"\" maybe=\"\" will=\"\" just=\"\" work=\"\" sometimes.=\"\" or=\"\" toddler=\"\" hard=\"\" time=\"\" falling=\"\" own,=\"\" problem=\"\" parent's=\"\" desires=\"\" –=\"\" they=\"\" enjoy=\"\" singing,=\"\" swaddling,=\"\" with=\"\" baby,=\"\" thinking=\"\" easier=\"\" for=\"\" asleep.=\"\" pp=\"\" \"some=\"\" parents=\"\" have=\"\" gotten=\"\" used=\"\" putting=\"\" children=\"\" sleep=\"\" while=\"\" driving=\"\" around=\"\" block=\"\" hustle=\"\" living=\"\" room=\"\" when=\"\" television=\"\" on,=\"\" some=\"\" go=\"\" too=\"\" far=\"\" operate=\"\" vacuum=\"\" cleaner=\"\" hair=\"\" dryer=\"\" create=\"\" monotonous=\"\" mechanical=\"\" noise=\"\" babies=\"\" difficulty=\"\" great,=\"\" impossible=\"\" rule=\"\" out=\"\" different=\"\" ways=\"\" which=\"\" think=\"\" can=\"\" babies,=\"\" but=\"\" avoided=\"\" (and=\"\" later=\"\" child)=\"\" learn=\"\" without=\"\" own.\"=\"\" href=\"https://youtu.be/vgibO6Vc344\" target=\"_blank\" few=\"\" methods=\"\" improve=\"\" ability=\"\" through=\"\" movement=\"\" a.=\"\" most=\"\" find=\"\" difficult=\"\" because=\"\" not=\"\" get=\"\" right=\"\" conditions=\"\" include=\"\" physical=\"\" ease,=\"\" security,=\"\" movement,=\"\" closeness=\"\" parents,=\"\" basic=\"\" known=\"\" parents.=\"\" also,=\"\" problems=\"\" affect=\"\" sleep:=\"\" breathing=\"\" problems,=\"\" high=\"\" muscle=\"\" tone,=\"\" torticollis,=\"\" cervical=\"\" so=\"\" on.=\"\" try=\"\" a,=\"\" take=\"\" several=\"\" steps:=\"\" moving=\"\" rhythms=\"\" gradually=\"\" reduce=\"\" rate=\"\" total=\"\" relaxation.=\"\" has=\"\" become=\"\" accustomed=\"\" womb.=\"\" voice=\"\" parallel=\"\" we=\"\" use=\"\" voice.=\"\" start=\"\" louder=\"\" relaxed,=\"\" then=\"\" tone=\"\" down.=\"\" many=\"\" fear=\"\" hands=\"\" thus=\"\" calm=\"\" him=\"\" regularly,=\"\" claim=\"\" correct=\"\" above=\"\" met,=\"\" after=\"\" place=\"\" immediately=\"\" her=\"\" bed.\"=\"\" three=\"\" months=\"\" life,=\"\" must=\"\" swaddle=\"\" safest=\"\" condition.=\"\" age=\"\" four=\"\" months,=\"\" received=\"\" dose=\"\" safety,=\"\" offering=\"\" separately.=\"\" process=\"\" simple=\"\" done=\"\" gradually,=\"\" forget=\"\" learning=\"\" adapting=\"\" new=\"\" life.=\"\">What to do when independent sleeping fails and it is accompanied by weeping and crying?</p>\n<p \"=\"\" first,=\"\" crying=\"\" does=\"\" not=\"\" have=\"\" to=\"\" be=\"\" an=\"\" alarm=\"\" clock=\"\" for=\"\" parents=\"\" and=\"\" you=\"\" should=\"\" alarmed=\"\" by=\"\" any=\"\" whimpering.=\"\" it=\"\" is=\"\" very=\"\" important=\"\" acknowledge=\"\" your=\"\" baby=\"\" when=\"\" he=\"\" or=\"\" she=\"\" cries,=\"\" but=\"\" do=\"\" jump=\"\" up=\"\" make=\"\" him=\"\" her=\"\" stop=\"\" immediately.=\"\" a=\"\" parent=\"\" also=\"\" know=\"\" how=\"\" contain=\"\" baby’s=\"\" crying.=\"\" this=\"\" part=\"\" of=\"\" parenting.=\"\" pp=\"\">In that case, you can come to the room and calm your baby down.
