    htmlContent: "<h1>The basic guide to baby sleep every parent should start with.</h1>\n<p>Hush baby hush … At nighttime we sleep: the basic sleeping guide for parents and babies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-training-and-baby-sleep-schedule/\">Your baby’s sleeping habits depend first on you the parent</a>. What is important to know and do at any age, and no less important – what not to do. Welcome to the family guide for your infant sleep.</p>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you see signs of fatigue appear, signs like: rubbing eyes, pulling ears, crying etc. this is the time to lay your baby to sleep. A baby should sleep on a hard mattress – lying on his back.</li>\n<li>From the early age of 6 months, you should avoid “helping” your baby fall asleep: do not swing or hold them on your hands, and don’t stay long in their room so that they will learn to fall asleep on their own.</li>\n<li>From the age of one to three years, your baby should already know how to fall asleep on their own and sleep most of the night. It is also a great age to start and set clear boundaries with sleep and in general.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your baby had you up all night? The same old tired you at work feeling like a zombie with red eyes? Keep in mind that you determine your baby’s sleeping habits, <a href=\"/courses/babypillars-sleep-plan/\">and you can also change them.</a></p>\n<p>Every baby has his/her own patterns of sleep and wakefulness that are naturally divided throughout the day. Every baby has short periods of waking during the night (yes every baby). Each baby is different from the other, and your child’s sleeping habits may be different from your friends’ baby sleeping habits or different from your adult children’s sleeping habits when they were the same age.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-chart-how-long-should-a-baby-really-sleep/\">Once you have identified your baby’s day by day sleeping pattern</a>, you can plan your day routine to help your baby (and the rest of the family) sleep better and sleep well. These sleeping patterns affects your infant behaviour throughout the day, his/her development, health and his/her overall state of life.</p>\n<h2>From birth until two months baby sleep</h2>\n<p>In the first few weeks after birth, your baby’s sleep may be fragmented during the day it’s OK and very normal. Each sleep chapter can take between half an hour and three hours, and the night’s sleep cycle may be interrupted by periods of waking. Around the age of six weeks, <a href=\"/blog/5-steps-for-a-better-quitter-night-sleep/\">your baby sleeping pattern should begin to organise in a more orderly fashion</a>. During sleep you may see your baby active: sucking, making jerky movements in his/her hands, smiling, making movements with his/her mouth. All of these reflect normal sleep for this age.</p>\n<h2>Two months to a year baby sleep</h2>\n<p>During this stage of your baby life your baby should gradually acquires regular and predictable sleep habits. <a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">Between 2 months and 4 months</a> you will notice a fairly constant rhythm of sleep and wakefulness during the day. From the age of three months to six months, most babies begin to sleep most of the night. At the age of twelve months’ infants need less sleep during daytime and the amount of daytime sleeps are reduced from three or four times a day to only once or twice a day.</p>\n<h2>One to three years baby sleep</h2>\n<p>Toddlers will usually give up the morning nap from the age of 18 months or so. The need for an afternoon will usually disappear between the ages of three and five years. At this point, <a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-struggles/\">most infants will sleep a continuous night</a>, but different events (such as illness, walking, or moving) may temporarily interfere with their normal <a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-chart-understanding-your-babys-sleep-patterns\">sleep pattern</a>s.</p>\n<p>From a cot to a bed – The transition to a single bed or a child bed may be characterised by some adjustments and difficulties, especially if it is too early in your child’s life. Most toddlers move from a cot to a bed between the ages of two and four.</p>\n<p>If you find it difficult to wake up your child in the morning, he or she may not sleep as well as you think at night. The length of sleep varies from child to child, but in most cases, the hours needed for a child are quite regular.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/your-personal-baby-sleep-guide-Falling-Asleep-Faster-e1628778139910.jpg\" alt=\"baby sleep guide\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>How long should a baby sleep?</h2>\n<p>From birth to about 2 months’ sleep is irregular (sorry mammy), but overall the expected sleep duration for a baby for a day ranges from 10 to 18 hours and on average: 14 hours and a half.</p>\n<p>Between the ages of 2 months and 2 years’ your baby day sleep schedule is more continuous and includes fewer sleep periods a day and longer hours through the night. The average duration of sleep in a day is 14 hours and a half: 11-10 hours at night and 3-5 hours throughout the day.</p>\n<p>Between one and three years of age, your cute toddler becomes much more active during the day and should sleep continuously at night. The expected length of sleep is 13-14 hours on average: about 11 hours and a half at night and another two hours throughout the day.</p>\n<h2>How to help your baby sleep better?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/the-4-pillars-of-falling-asleep-faster/\">Put your baby to sleep immediately when you notice the signs of fatigue</a>: rubbing his/her eyes, pulling ears, crying etc. In the first two months you can help your baby fall asleep by swinging the crib or feeding until they and you fall asleep, but from the age of three months on, you should gradually avoid doing so and give your baby regular sleep habits. A baby has to sleep on a hard mattress and when he/she lies on their back.</p>\n<p>After about two months’ start focusing on regular sleep habits like: darken the room at night and throughout the day while going to sleep, reduce your baby’s social activity at night and before bedtime etc. If you are tired, ask your partner or a family member to allow you a recharge and look after your baby, make sure you sleep and fill in the missing hours of sleep you as the parent so desperately need. Tired and nervous parents do not do their job properly. When you wake up, continue to take care of the baby, much more relaxed and re energised.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/3-6-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">When your baby is two to three-month-old you should start building normal and regular sleeping habits</a>. Consider things that both you and your baby will enjoy: bath time, baby massage, changing your clothes into sleepwear (PJs), hugging and kissing gently, a quiet and pleasant song or anything that pleases you and your baby. It is advisable to repeat these sleeping activities and habits you chose every evening, even when someone else puts your baby down to sleep.</p>\n<p>Starting from the age of six months, you should avoid “helping” your baby fall asleep: do not swing or hold on your hands, and do not stay for a long time in his/her room so that he or she learns to fall asleep on their own. Babies tend to wake up every hour and a half, and if you get them <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/safe-sleep/\" title=\"AAP Safe Sleep Guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">back to sleep</a> with help, they will need this help also at night when they wake up. It is important to start this process around the age of six months.</p>\n<h2>Baby Bedtime Routine</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-questions-and-answers/\">The bedtime routine should not be long, and the last stage of the routine should be in your baby’s room</a>. A pleasant and relaxing environment for sleeping is a darken room which is ventilated and quiet. The degree of lighting during bedtime should be similar to the degree of lighting during sleep time (and without TV flickers or mobile device). Lay your baby down when he/she is tired but still awake. Thus your baby will get used to falling asleep on his/her own even when he/she wakes up at night.</p>\n<p>Between the ages of one to three years, your child should already know how to fall asleep on his/her own and sleep most of the night. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWJDOa55nT8\">It is important to continue to maintain your regular sleeping habits and routine</a> and the hours of sleep and awakening should be fixed both at day time and at night. It is also the age to start and set clear sleep boundaries. For example, read your baby a story before bedtime, you will notice that your baby will ask again and again to read to him/her one more time or to have a drink of water or give a kiss to Dad, they just want to postpone bed time as much as they can.</p><p style=\"margin-top:1.5em\"><strong>Ready to support your baby’s development?</strong> <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">Explore the BabyPillars program</a>, milestone-based guidance for every stage.</p>",

    htmlContent: "<blockquote><p>Parents eagerly await the day when their baby is ready to stretch her legs and start walking on her own, they always ask when do babies start walking. Walking is a more complicated and advanced milestone, with several requirements for muscle development and coordination. Because of this, many children work up to walking slowly, and they have a wide range of time for when they are expected to start walking. Babies typically begin to walk around nine months, but it can be as late as fifteen months before they start. Most of the timing of when they will begin to walk is determined by the child’s will as much as their surroundings and available resources. This will further affect their ability to walk at a more practiced level. When a baby begins walking around nine months, it is easier for them to be walking more confidently on their own around fifteen months. So while some early and eager babies are walking well enough on their own, other solid and steady babies might just be beginning to try their legs out. Typically, your baby will be walking on his or her own by the age of two.</p></blockquote>\n<h1>When Babies Start Walking?</h1>\n<p>What parent doesn’t like to see his or her child begin to walk? <a href=\"/blog/parenting-tips/\">Walking is one of the bigger milestones</a>, and it is because of this that a lot of time is needed in order to bring the action into fruition, and indeed, a lot of time is given.</p>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to estimate when your child will begin to walk is to find out when you and the baby’s other parent began to walk. Genetics will have some critical influence over the development of the baby in the beginning of his life; this will be seen again and again, and walking is one of the ways in which it can give you an estimate to start with. It is important to remember that estimations are just that, and they can be tweaked as new information comes. For example, if you and your spouse both walked at around nine months, it would be reasonable to estimate that your child will begin to walk around the same time. With this, my husband and I were both early walkers, and our children ended up beginning to walk around the nine-month mark.</p>\n<p>While it is good to keep your baby’s genetic heritage in mind, it will still be possible that your child will have no interest in moving around on his own; this is part of the reason understanding your baby’s temperament will also allow you to give your baby reasonable expectations for his milestones, including walking. This is important to remember especially so you do not try to push your son or daughter into walking too soon, which can be both harmful and counteractive.</p>\n<p>Walking is not a simple movement. Everything that the child has done since birth will affect his or her ability and desire to walk. For example, their eyesight should be developed so they can see different things and cultivate an interest in checking those things out. A sense of curiosity and wonder about the world around them should also be encouraged; this sense of adventure and excitement will often prompt babies to begin moving, as seen in crawling, and pulling themselves up on their feet to see higher up. Along with this, their muscles need to be developed enough where their legs can support them, they are able to establish and keep their balance, and they have the upper body strength to get up onto their feet in the first place. Walking is a complicated motion, one that is built up over months of learning how to sit, crawl, and pull up on objects.</p>\n<h2>So When Do Babies Start Walking?</h2>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/when-do-babies-start-walking-When-Do-Babies-Start-Walking-For-The-First-Time-e1628844567358.jpg\" alt=\"When Do Babies Start Walking For The First Time\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Strategies to Get Your Baby Moving</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/course/developing-walking-and-movement-in-space-the-fun-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">There are several techniques and approaches you can use in order to help get your baby up and walking</a>. Starting out with help in moving, using a lure, and working with different devices and toys have all shown positive results among parents.</p>\n<p>Most parents are comfortable starting out small. They help a child sit up by sitting behind them, <a href=\"/blog/child-start-walking/\">and they want to help their child by holding his arms or his belly while he tries walking</a>. This is where you can easily walk your child through the different movements that will help him transition from sitting up to walking. If you have your spouse or a second part of hands, one of you will be able to use your hands to steady your baby as he attempts to take steps. You can gradually loosen your support while he begins to walk more confidently.</p>\n<p>Using a lure can be an effective method of getting your baby interested in moving. Many babies will begin crawling in hopes of getting milk from their mom or their bottle. Food can be seen as a good incentive. My husband and I would sometimes put little cheddar goldfish on the coffee table, to see if our kids wanted it enough to reach up and pull themselves up, more than once they were able to knock the goldfish crackers off the table, so you’ll need to be more clever about it than we were. This encouraged them to try to get up off the floor and balance on their feet. I’ve heard of other parents doing similar things, such as leaving toys up on tables or on the couch in order to get their kids to try to practice both pulling themselves up as well as walking.</p>\n<p>Devices and walking toys can be helpful in some cases in getting your child to start walking. However, there has been some controversy among the parenting community regarding devices like walkers. Some people have found that they are dangerous in homes with stairs, for example, and others have had their children develop bowlegs as a result of using a walker or bouncer too early. For this one, it is best to research all of the positive and negative reviews and reports on them. I have found this method of research to be very helpful in establishing good judgments on these matters. Sometimes understanding the wide range of differences can help you see where you will stand on the issue. For my family, my kids had a walker that doubled up as a bouncy seat. We didn’t have any staircases in our house, and it was carpeted, so most of the complaints about the walker did not apply to us. We did change our mind about the bumbo chair, however, where there were several studies that showed it could be detrimental to the baby’s spinal development. Since we did not want to worry about that, we got rid of the bumbo chair.</p>\n<p>One thing we did keep using was a musical stroller. We had a small, baby doll stroller that our son would use to grip onto the handles and be able to push it. While it was in motion, the stroller would play music and he would laugh as well as enjoy the incentive of moving so it would keep playing. This is something that I would still highly recommend to parents, as my daughter also really loved it.</p>\n<p>Many parents have used toys and even obedient pets as helpful items to get their kids moving. Putting toys up on counters, or items that have been lying around on the floor while your child was learning to crawl, for example, can be helpful and similar to the use of the lure technique. Using a toy instead of an edible lure, like my family with the goldfish crackers, can be helpful in that your child will be able to do this many times without getting upset that her food is gone, and you can easily take the opportunity to specifically work through the different motions. Showing your baby each step of getting up, from crawling on their bellies, to pushing up with their arms, to getting on their knees, to pulling up with their arms, and finally balancing with their feet on the ground, all of these steps add practice time while they have a toy to distract them and you to help them.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Start Walking?</h2>\n<h2>Building Confidence</h2>\n<p>Confidence comes with practice and encouragement. This is where knowing your child and her preferences can really help. In addition to praising your kids for taking their steps, and your comfort when they fall, you can also use your words to cheer them on. While hugs and kisses and snuggles can usually solve tears, you might want to consider using treats or small snacks to encourage your child to get up and move more. I would call my children’s names and tell them I had some applesauce or pudding for them, and that would make them come quickly (Mom’s food is always the best.) In addition, you can take pictures. Taking pictures might be able to help you as much as it can help them; you will be able to see their progress as they continue to try, and when they finally start to walk in strides, you will be able to really see the changes. Even though the babies will go through many changes physically during this time, it can be amazing to see it replayed on videos or in pictures. There are a lot of smaller details that your memory can lose over time.</p>\n<h2>When to Consult a Doctor</h2>\n<p>If you are nearing the fifteen-month mark of your baby’s life, and he or she is still not walking, this might be a good time to set up an appointment with your baby’s doctor. It is still considered normal for a child at this age to be working up to walking; some parents have said that their children did not walk until seventeen or eighteen months of age. However, if you are unsure of your child’s muscle development, or your baby seems to have little interest in the world around him or her, then it would be best to seek professional advice.</p>\n<p>There are some conditions which can affect your child’s ability to walk. I know several mothers who have had <a href=\"/blog/premature-baby-care\">preemie</a> babies that they were guided to a therapist in order to get their babies moving between the ages of one and two. Of course, if your baby was born earlier than expected, this is something that you would have kept in mind and expected. Still, there are baby therapists who can show you some exercises and work with your baby as he or she grows.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m-4OAEUA7I\">In addition to preemie babies, there are some health conditions which might affect your baby</a>, whether they have been passed through the baby’s genes or if there was some trauma related to the birth. Many children who experience these things can still easily live a normal life, and it is important to use their milestones as a way to keep planning for their next step with good expectations and hopeful attitudes.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Start Walking? Our Conclusion</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/6-9-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">Many babies will begin working up to walking long before they actually walk</a>. This is seen in their increasing movement and interest in everyday life; their ambition and adventurous endeavors will shine through their actions and their reactions. When your baby takes his or her first steps, you will see this clearly. Most babies will begin to walk around nine months, but they can learn to walk as late as fifteen months, or even possibly a few months later. In order to get to that point, and to encourage them to move beyond, it will require patience, understanding, and humility. Learning different tricks of the trade to get your baby moving can really help, and if you are struggling, your baby’s doctor will be more than able to answer your questions regarding your baby’s health and development. It is good to keep it in mind that all the work and love you put into your baby will be worth it in the end, when you see your child walking for the first time, and the pride you will feel as they walk confidently toward their future.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Now you know when do babies start walking.

    htmlContent: "<blockquote><p>Babies start talking around the six-month mark, but learning language is a more complex skill to acquire. As a result, even though a child may be able to say small words at six months, such as “mama,” or “dada,” or “baba,” she may not start talking clearly or talking in full sentences until she is two years or older. Some children do not speak well until they reach the age of four. Many factors, such as support, education, environment, and even genetics can influence how fast your child begins to talk clearly.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>When Do Babies Begin to Talk?</h2>\n<h2>From Babbling to Talking: An Introductory Overview</h2>\n<p>One of the bigger milestones that parents watch for is when babies start to talk. Parents eagerly await their child being able to talk clearly, use words well, and speak in full sentences. Who hasn’t tried to get their child to say “mama” or “dada” as a first word? Besides walking, talking is the most anticipated milestone among parents, especially new parents.</p>\n<h3>0-3 Months</h3>\n<p>Many experts will agree that it is never too early to begin teaching your child about language. Even while your baby is still in the womb, it is good to talk to him or her and let your baby become accustomed to your voice; this is not only a good bonding experience between the parents and the baby, but it is also a great way to get the baby to associate your voice with kindness and interest. This will help their learning ability and interest to grow later on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/course/developing-communication-gibberish-and-laughter/\">Once the baby is born, talking to your baby continues this same idea</a>. There are a couple of different ways to engage your child in working on his speech; it is good to try out the different methods a few times each, to see what your baby responds to and what she likes. The first method is simple; it is just talking to your baby. You can talk regularly, telling your baby what you are doing or what you are thinking. Many people call this way the more organic way of doing things, because it is just like having a one-sided conversation. You can also try stimulating your baby’s interest by using props. Getting your baby used to words by showing items or objects such as toys, or words and pictures on flash cards, means you are helping them to absorb the language and also allows them to observe you as you speak. Many babies will learn to imitate the sounds they hear by mimicking the way the mouth moves. I have a mom who is a speech-language pathologist, and she will often help kids learn new words by forming a child’s mouth, lips, and movement in the shape of the word. You can do similar things, by enunciating, and encouraging your child to do simple movements. At <a href=\"/0-3-months-baby\">0-3 month</a>s, many “b” sounds are easily encouraged as the bilabial sounds are among the easiest to develop. “M” sounds are also common because the baby commonly starts out with no teeth, making the “m” sound easier, even though the movement of the lips together can stump them for a bit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">During the 0-3 month period, some babies can learn several new words</a>; however, these words will likely not be traditional or formal words. They will be more like syllables or gargles. Sounds like “ba” for bottle, for example, will indicate more of what he or she is saying. As your child grows, he will learn about how to say different sounds and make the connection between different names and objects. There is no need to worry about teaching him or feeling like a failure if he does not learn any specific words during this time. It is unlikely during this time that your baby will say words, but her sounds and her syllables will be able to give you hints as to what she wants or what she needs.</p>\n<h3>3-6 Months</h3>\n<p>When Do Babies Begin to Talk: By the 3-6 mark of your baby’s first year, your baby has begun to move his legs and arms more, and lift his head and enjoy <a href=\"/blog/tummy-time\">tummy time</a> much more. This is a time where they are seeing more of the world, and they are growing into their routines. It was during this time for my children that a routine became more obvious. <a href=\"/course/6-month-baby-daily-routine/\">Routines can be a good thing, because it can really help new parents find time to structure in learning activities</a>; however, early on in the baby’s life, routines will need to be evaluated more often as the child grows. My son, for example, did not want to have his third nap of the day after he reached the six-month mark. For my daughter, she did not enjoy tummy time unless my husband was home to play with her. Eventually, as she began crawling, she would prefer me to sit with her while she moved around.</p>\n<p>When it comes to routines with language, at this age it can be more easy to sit the baby down in a high chair and work on his language using toys and food, or showing him objects while he is sitting. This is where some friends of mine would use flash cards, to help the baby learn new words. Others I know would play short movies, usually with songs with motions, like “If You’re Happy and You Know It,” or “Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAmp4nWZ3_w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">As your baby gets closer to the six-month mark, it is likely that he will begin trying to sound out words</a>. Even if he or she cannot be clear about it, it is good to encourage your child in his or her efforts. During this time, it is possible for “mama” and “dada” to come up.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/when-do-babies-begin-to-talk-When-Do-Babies-Begin-to-Talk-1-e1628843638922.jpg\" alt=\"When Do Babies Begin to Talk Guide\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>So, When Do Babies Begin to Talk?</h2>\n<h3>6-12 Months</h3>\n<p>When Do Babies Begin to Talk: Between six and twelve months is when babies will start saying more words. This is the time when most experts agree that your baby will begin using words such as “mama” and “dada” and other easy words as well, usually no more than two syllables in length. During this time, infants will learn between five and ten new words, likely phrases or words they hear at home. My kids learned “kitty” very quickly, because we had two cats running around the house. Many parents will see the same things happening around their kids and their lives.</p>\n<h3>12-24 Months</h3>\n<p>A growing pattern of progress should continue during this time. Around the eighteenth month mark, your child will begin to form sentences with two or more words. Their vocabulary and knowledge of different words will continue to grow, though it may take some time to see significant progress, depending on the level of exposure. Many parents with more than one child will find that the subsequent children are able to pick up language use more quickly. This largely results from more exposure. I know my children play together, and because of this, there is a large amount of time that they spent interacting with the same toys and places. This is another reason why several parents who put their kids in daycare will often see progress differently from parents who keep their babies at home, particularly if their child is their only child. This difference among the way parents raise kids and the environments in which they live and work is also another reason why some kids respond differently to learning language.</p>\n<p>As your baby grows into a toddler, their command of language will reflect that. They will likely be able to identify more objects and they will begin to repeat phrases. This is where the parents become more alert when it comes to their children hearing particular phrases or family secrets, fearful that it might be repeated or brought up in the wrong context. While this prompts more caution and discreteness from parents.</p>\n<h2>Things to Watch</h2>\n<p>When Do Babies Begin to Talk: <a href=\"/blog/infant-growth-spurts-what-does-it-mean-what-to-do/\">Since every child grows and learns at his or her own pace</a>, and learning something as complex as language requires time, practice, and incentive, it can be difficult to determine if there is an exact time to worry. If you suspect your child has a speech problem, whether it is learning new words, or remembering old words, you may want to consult with the child’s <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/\" title=\"AAP HealthyChildren.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pediatrician</a>. Having some documentation can also help, especially in the event that your baby’s doctor will ask for specific examples or concerns. This is part of the reason many speech and communication disorders are able to be formally diagnosed between two and three years of age now.</p>\n<p>Genetics can also offer a clue when it comes time to worry. Many people will look to their peers and their peers’ children to gauge where their kids are in terms of development. However, it is better to look at family history for milestone development, including when kids will begin to talk.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Begin to Talk? Resources</h2>\n<p>A lot of things will affect your child’s ability to begin to talk and learn new words. Having a supportive home, where the parents can spend time with the baby, is a large part of that. Supportive environments can easily allow for parents to be focused on the future development of their babies, so that the parents can try out new ways to keep their children’s interests high. When kids are interested, they will learn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/course/developing-communication-gibberish-and-laughter/\">When it comes to helping your baby learn to talk, the best resource you have is yourself</a>. Surrounding the baby with people talking to him directly will help him learn how to use words to communicate with other people. Exposure to words, giving your baby a chance to mimic your words and mouth’s movements, all of this helps your baby learn to talk. There are several other things you as a parent can do to help your child learn. Many parents will sing to their children, and ask questions, keeping their attention, and using their time together to bond with simple and silly songs. It can be scary to sing to your children at first, but some kids do love it a lot. My son was not adverse to it, but my daughter just loved it. It was not long before she would try to sing along, even though she wasn’t sure of the words. She would use her voice to do the different pitches while I sang.</p>\n<p>Books are great to introduce to children early on. This can also help with language development, and books will become more of a resource when your baby is ready to learn how to read. Just as learning how to speak is a process that can span over the first several years of your baby’s life, learning to read requires several years, too. That is part of the reason there is a strong correlation between early readers and books; getting your children to love learning and seeing you love spending the time to teach them is a valuable gift.</p>\n<p>In addition to reading, singing, and talking, it can also be fun to take a look at the technology available to helping you and your baby develop her skills. There are several applications and technologies that will help your child engage with new words and pictures. I have known several parents who will buy games for their phones specifically for their children, in case they are needed for particular situations, such as when the child has to wait. The good news about this is that there are a lot of programs and companies that design apps for helping kids learn and play. There are several free and inexpensive learning puzzles, games, pictures, and activities available for Apple and Android products.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>When Do Babies Begin to Talk: When it comes to growing, particularly for talking, many babies will find and settle into their own paces. Learning is different for every child, and since language is much more complex than it seems to an adult, babies talk at a variety of different times. <a href=\"/blog/baby-communication-tips/\">While most babies can begin using words as early as six months</a>, it is important to keep in mind that time, practice, and growth will all factor into your baby’s ability to speak. Over the course of the first two to four years of their lives, they will learn how to use words and language to communicate. By the time they are three years old, they will be using sentences, longer and clearer, to talk with others.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Please write your thoughts and comments on this article and in general in the comments section below.</strong></em></p><p style=\"margin-top:1.5em\"><strong>Ready to support your baby’s development?</strong> <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">Explore the BabyPillars program</a>, milestone-based guidance for every stage.</p>",

Complete Parents Guide.</h1>\n<h2>Babies Sitting Up: An Introductory Overview</h2>\n<p>Babies often sit up when they are close to four months old. On average, it takes babies between four and seven months to be able to sit up. There are several other milestones that a baby can reach during this time that are complementary to this skill, largely because it requires the same degree of physical development and autonomy. Below are some of the specific signs, accompanied by more details.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/6-9-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">Once you recognize the signs that your baby is ready to sit up</a>, there are several techniques and tricks of the trade you can use to help him develop this skill and achieve this milestone. All of the techniques listed here are supportive and easily incorporated into routine for the baby, so it will be simple for you as a parent to encourage your child to grow in a healthy, happy manner.</p>\n<p>Developing skills often take time. In addition to listing some of the techniques you can use, there are also some general tips for attitude and intention on your part as the parent. The hardest part of being a parent is mastering consistency. Many people often forget that parenting requires the parents to be learners as much as they are teachers. When it comes to working with sitting up, being a pillar of support will be a literal as well as metaphorical role. Much like their children, it is good for parents to remain focused but flexible.</p>\n<p>With every milestone, there does come a point where questions and concerns plague the parents, especially if the milestone is not reached in the average amount of time, or even for a significant period after the milestone’s parameters. Because of this concern, there are some signs that you might want to ask a doctor about.</p>\n<p>Finally, sitting up has several signs, but it is also a sign in itself; your baby is growing and getting ready to take on the world on her own terms. It is a warm, fun time in your baby’s life, and just like things that are fun, there are some times when things can seem too hard, too stressful, and too worrisome. But keep in mind that all babies, as much as we might hate it some days and long for it on others, were meant to grow up and grow into adults. We must be vigilant and supportive without being smothering; we must be brave and face our fear as our child begins to face his world.</p>\n<p>Sitting up is a milestone many parents look for and ask (<a href=\"/blog/baby-sitting\">when do babies sit</a> up?), especially as a precursor to walking. Signs for sitting up usually occur around three months, making the average amount of time it takes for babies to sit up around four months. Up to this point, babies are getting more exercise with tummy time, strengthening their core muscles and their necks and backs; these are the critical areas babies need to develop in order to sit up. While time and practice is the best method for getting your baby ready to sit up, there are some techniques and resources which can help facilitate this milestone development.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Sit Up? Complete Parent Guide.</h2>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/when-do-babies-sit-up-When-Do-Babies-Sit-Up.jpg\" alt=\"When Do Babies Sit Up\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Signs Your Baby is Ready to Begin Sitting Up</h2>\n<p>At the four-month mark, as mentioned in previous articles, there are other similar skills which are being developed. At this point, your baby is likely able to roll from his tummy to his back, or he is working towards it. This is one of the signs that your baby is ready to try sitting. To be fully prepared for this, there are physical requirements, and supplementary support from parents.</p>\n<p>If you think about what it takes to be able to sit up, particularly sitting up straight, it might be easy or tempting to think it is simple just because it is easy. For a baby to sit up, her muscles in her back and neck will need to be strong enough to hold up her head and keep her balance. Balance also comes into play concerning her hips. Keeping balance with the hipbones is what allows people to sit up continuously. Finally, your baby’s muscles will also have to work in order for her to be able to move her body into position.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/child-start-walking/\">Many parents will help their babies learn to sit up by placing them on their laps</a>. Many times, my kids have begun learning to sit as they sat in my lap and leaned against my torso and supported their legs against mine. This is how many parents will go about starting the process of learning to sit up for their children. It is a nice way; I know this from experience as well as doctor recommendations. If you place your baby in a sitting position on the floor by herself, she will likely slump over or fall to her tummy in a matter of seconds.</p>\n<p>Another common sign that your baby is ready to sit up on his own is moving his feet, or reaching for objects out of his reach. If your baby shows a growing determination and curiosity for the world around him, it is likely that he will begin to experiment with sitting up, moving, and <a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-roll-over\">rolling over</a> soon.</p>\n<h2>Developing Sitting Skills</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/GKX-nG6_oig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Getting a baby used to the sitting position is part of practicing</a>. This is part of the reason that I would sit my kids on my lap first; it is a good way to <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">get started</a>, because it is good in getting them used to the movements as well as getting them used to the positions. This helps them ease into it, and you can begin teaching them how to sit up by going backwards, starting from the sitting position, and going back down to their tummy or their back. This can also help your baby with his skills in rolling over; extra benefits are always nice for parents, too. I have noticed with my new parent friends especially that there is a bit more hesitation when you get started, so having the baby sit in your lap might be just as supportive and comforting to you as it is to your child.</p>\n<p>As you continue to engage with your baby, during your time practicing, you will begin to see further signs your baby is ready to go from sitting in your lap to sitting up on his or her own. It is likely that if you practice often from the four-month mark, especially going over the motions required to move from a laying down position to a sit-up position, your baby will do it on his own when he wants to.</p>\n<p>With this new amount of freedom your baby has, there are always some things in which general rules will help. To prevent unpleasant accidents, make sure your child has plenty of open space to explore. Keeping your baby on a blanket or sheet while you practice can also help. This is something that might especially come in handy if you have hard floors in your home. For my kids, I had a play mat that was just large enough for me to lay them on and have some space for me to sit next to them. I would teach them to sit up by preparing them on the mat, and at first, they would sit up on that mat. Of course, once they got more curious, they would crawl and move off the mat.</p>\n<h2>Things to Watch For…</h2>\n<p>In addition to watching the surroundings of your baby as he learns to sit up, there are other areas in which parents might find themselves concerned. One concern in particular is that your baby does not seem interested in sitting up, or they are delayed in sitting up past the first seven months. For this, it is best to talk to your doctor. Many parents worry that their baby is not eating enough, <a href=\"/course/baby-sleep-techniques/\">not sleeping enough, not moving around enough</a>; this is where a family doctor will be able to point you in the right direction for a specialist. I had a friend who had complications during birth, and as a result, even though her son was healthy, he had about a month delay on sitting up and standing, and several other milestones as well. He worked with a physical therapist for a while, and gradually it became much easier for him to move around. Today, he is just as fast and sharp as his peers.</p>\n<p>Because sitting up is related to other milestones, and is often seen as a precursor to specific milestones such as crawling, standing, and walking, it is a good idea to make sure that you, as a parent, have a support system. Today, many people seem to know a lot of people, but it is hard to find people who you trust. Trusting people with your kids is especially challenging for many. To help this, once your baby begins to move and sit up, make sure you have someone who can help you with the day to day duties of running a household or can help you watch your child when you are tired. It is very, very taxing to be vigilant all the time, and as your baby begins to sit up and move around, it is good to establish trust so others can help relieve you when you need it. For me, I had some family members nearby who would come when they could, and I have a friend as my permanent babysitter who comes when I need help or I go to work. If you are not able to afford a sitter or daycare, try to find a friend who can swap off babysitting duties with you. I have a couple of friends who do that, and they all agree it is a good way for their kids to socialize while giving one mom a break.</p>\n<p>Sitting up is a milestone many parents look for, especially as a precursor to walking. Signs for sitting up usually occur around three months, making the average amount of time it takes for babies to sit up around four months. Up to this point, babies are getting more exercise with tummy time, strengthening their core muscles and their necks and backs; these are the critical areas babies need to develop in order to sit up. While time and practice is the best method for getting your baby ready to sit up, there are some techniques and resources which can help facilitate this milestone development.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Sit Up? Complete Parents Guide.</h2>\n<h2>Resources to Help Parents</h2>\n<p>Sitting up can be one of the milestones that is taken for granted. After all, many babies seem to sit up on their own as they sit down in their high chairs, or they sit in their baby swings or baby seats. How hard could it be to go from that to sitting up on their own? Since it can be more complicated than meets the eyes, there are some products that can help.</p>\n<p>Bumbo seats have mixed reviews among parents and professionals, but they are there to get your child into a safe position where his back is straight. The seat does not allow him to sit up unassisted, but if you are unable to sit with your child, this could be a good substitute to get him used to how it feels to sit up.</p>\n<p>With the Bumbo seats, there are several variations of the product; some have trays, which make it easy to sit your baby down and allow him to eat sitting up. There are other seats, too, which will buckle your child in and allow them to sit up straight.</p>\n<p>While it is not a physical resource, there are some exercises that you can go through with your child. These movements can help your baby go from lying on her back to sitting up all on her own with enough time, patience, and practice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/3-6-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">It is important to remember that sitting up is a common milestone for babies to achieve around four to seven months</a>. However, many babies can take their time in achieving it, and there is little cause for concern if he or she does not want to pursue it as much as another baby might. New parents in particular seemed stressed if their child does not meet a milestone or even exceed it; parents with two or more kids are more relaxed and confident in situations like this.</p>\n<h2>Baby Sitting Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Sitting up is a milestone many parents look for as a sign their baby is growing and healthy. While this is the case, it can take time for your child to decide he or she wants to pursue this milestone, and it may take time for your baby’s muscles to develop and strengthen. Many factors, such as genetics, health, and stimulation all play a critical role in this stage of baby development. Keeping this in mind, <a href=\"/blog/baby-growth-parents/\">as you study your baby’s growth</a>, you should be able to hold him to realistic and flexible expectations.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Please share your thoughts and comments on this article in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>",

    htmlContent: "<h2>When Do Babies Sleep Through the Night?</h2>\n<h3>Babies Sleeping Through the Night: An Introductory Overview.</h3>\n<p>Babies do not typically come out of the womb and begin sleeping through the night right away, as much as her mother might want her to. A baby is born and instantly she needs to have her needs met. When the baby was still inside its mother, she was able to get fed constantly, and it was easy for her to have her other needs taken care of.</p>\n<p>Once a baby is born, a baby still needs to be fed, changed, and have her tummy settled. This is a large part of the reason why it is so hard to get a baby to sleep through the night once she is born; all of these procedures and requirements have to be met in order for a baby to get a good night’s sleep.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/course/baby-sleep-plan-3-2-2/\">When a baby is born, for the first several weeks, mothers can easily feel like zombies</a>, as they are constantly getting up and trying to take care of not only their baby, but their house, and if they are able, themselves. Many times after the birth of my children, I heard the mantra, “You need to sleep when the baby is sleeping.”</p>\n<p>But it can be surprising to new mothers just how hard it is to get a shower without feeling like you should be sleeping instead, and it is hard not to notice how dirty or disorganized the home looks once you have had a baby. On top of that, there are groceries to buy, laundry to fold, and bills to pay. Because there are a lot of things on the parents’ “To-do” list, <a href=\"/blog/baby-milestones-month-by-month-for-the-first-year/\">new mothers and fathers can easily be overwhelmed by the first weeks of parenthood</a>.</p>\n<p>During this time, it is important to recognize that it will end, and that it is a good thing that it will, because it means your baby is growing. It is also good to keep that in mind because you want to be able to realize that your sacrifice of your sleep now will help your child do better and feel better. It can be hard, especially if the mother suffers from post-partum, to get to a point where it is easy to give grace to others. It is also good to keep a mental checklist of what you do and try to repeat it.</p>\n<p>For example, many babies will feed before they go to sleep. Once the baby is asleep, if you do not feel like going to sleep, try to clean for ten minutes and then try lying down. I had a lot more success with my second child because I knew I would have trouble sleeping, and I was able to anticipate my moods better.</p>\n<p>Cleaning is a way of physically demonstrating that you are able to do some good while also helping to keep your emotions under control. This is helpful, because if you do not get enough sleep, it will be harder to control yourself. Once the baby has been fed, and you’ve done some cleaning and most likely some laundry organization, you will be a little more relaxed enough to at least lie down, if not fall asleep.</p>\n<p>Another good item to have on your checklist is the issue of diapers. When a baby is newly changed, they will have an easier time of sleeping. This is true of all children. If you have a clean diaper, you will sleep longer. I have done my share of midnight diaper changes, and it is always harder to put the baby <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/safe-sleep/\" title=\"AAP Safe Sleep Guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">back to sleep</a> if I have changed her. I would envy my friends who were capable of changing a diaper without waking their child in the process.</p>\n<p>Finally, checking your baby for her creature comforts can help. I had a winter baby and a summer baby, and to this day, I know which one needs a blanket and which one will kick all of the blankets off the bed if I dare to put on too many.</p>\n<p>Temperature, sound systems, and even air purifiers have all been suggestions I have heard to use in order to help my children get to sleep at night. Some parents will use essential oils, rubbing little droplets into the sheets, in order to help keep their baby asleep. Others will make sure that their child is positioned in a particular way, or certain music is playing.</p>\n<p>These are all great ideas which you can use as you need to. Babies can change, but <a href=\"/blog/5-steps-for-a-better-quitter-night-sleep/\">many people have found success in using bedtime routines</a>. Even later on in their lives, some kids will not go to bed unless it is completely silent; others will need everything from a blanket to water to music to the nightlight.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/babies-sleep-night-rolling-over-baby-to-side-scaled-e1628767562991.jpg\" alt=\"Baby sleep through the night\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h3>Making the Transition To Sleeping</h3>\n<p>As babies are growing, you can easily look for the opportunities to lengthen out their sleeping patterns as they grow. <a href=\"/blog/dream-feeding/\">Many newborns will need feedings pretty regularly, every three to four hours</a>, or with even less time in between. Once you see that you can go an extra fifteen, thirty, or even sixty minutes in between feedings, you can start to work in the different <a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-chart-understanding-your-babys-sleep-patterns\">sleep pattern</a>s.</p>\n<p>Transitioning slowly helps you as a parent as much as it can help the baby learn to sleep peacefully. Tending to their needs, and seeing to the conditions in which they need to fall asleep, really makes you <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">learn more</a> about your child’s temperament and personality. It also gives their mind and body time to adjust; while your baby is sleeping, plenty of things are still growing and going on inside of him.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, with the transition, it is good to have a way prepared for your baby to self-soothe. This can include popular measures such as pacifiers to help get your baby to lull himself back to sleep in the even he is startled awake. My children used the pacifier, but many of my friends have had kids that never seemed to want to take them. Some parents have discouraged this, because some babies will use their fingers or other body parts in order to soothe themselves back to sleep.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jdn8PCDzQE\">By the time your baby is six months old, you will also see that his physical body has changed and developed</a>, and more development is coming as he grows. It is around this time that many parents will see the eight-hour mark on sleeping through the night, as the brain is getting bigger and needs more time to recover from the events of the day. In later months, it will be easier for the babies to stay asleep as they grow and begin using more of their energy reserves for crawling, walking, and playing.</p>\n<p>With multiple children, it can happen that the second or third child will mimic more of the patterns of the older children. My son and daughter are prime examples of this; my soon took eighteen months to fall asleep for the whole night, whereas my daughter was staying asleep for the whole night in six months.</p>\n<p>When it comes to transitioning, you should keep in mind that there are days when you are allowed to backslide, and there are days where you have no progress. <a href=\"/blog/the-4-pillars-of-falling-asleep-faster/\">Many people think that routine and repetition will be positive</a>, so recognizing that it is possible for this not to happen will help keep your expectations realistic and achievable.</p>\n<h3>Resources and Recommendations</h3>\n<p>When it comes to resources, your baby’s doctor can be a source of invaluable information. Your <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/\" title=\"AAP HealthyChildren.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pediatrician</a>, especially if you have known your baby’s doctor for a time, can really give you insight into your child’s health. One of the best things about my baby’s doctor was just that she had a lot of experience, too, so she was able to identify a lot of things before I even finished complaining about them.</p>\n<p>For example, one of the things that she suggested when I was having trouble <a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">breastfeed</a>ing was to use the nipple shield, and she said I could use it for as long as I needed it, even though most doctors would not recommend using it past six months. Part of the reason she suggested this to me was actually because my babies had trouble sleeping, and most of it had to do with the fact that I wasn’t producing enough milk for them to feed. It is hard to get a baby to go to sleep when he is hungry.</p>\n<p>Another common experience that I have had as a parent and as a friend of parents is the question of sleeping with a full tummy. I had a friend whose son had severe acid reflux; because of this, it was hard to send him to bed if he had just eaten, but at the same time, most babies will sleep right after they have been fed. Since she was unsure of what to do, she and her husband would take their baby out in the car for a ride.</p>\n<p>The comfortable bumping would help with the baby’s reflux, and keeping him in an upright position in the car seat helped prevent him from waking up due to gas or reflux. She told me that because of that, she was eventually able to get her son to sleep, but he was over a year old before it happened. They didn’t think it was that big of a deal, but one they told their doctor, they were able to make better adjustments to their son’s routine.</p>\n<p>Another friend had a baby that had allergy problems in the spring and fall, but she thought it was just a simple cold. She was able to talk to her doctor and decide on a treatment plan for her son.</p>\n<p>If you are not sure of your child’s sleeping pattern, it is good to ask your doctor about it. Sometimes it seems like every little thing can ruin a baby’s slumber, so it can be very helpful to have questions prepared and ready to ask when you visit the doctor’s office.</p>\n<h3>When Do Babies Sleep Through The Night: Conclusion</h3>\n<p>After having children, sleeping through the night becomes one of the most ardent wishes. Many parents will see their newborns able to sleep in blocks of six to eight hours as early as three months, but more will likely see this later on. Some children do not fully sleep through the night until they are one year old.</p>\n<p>Whatever the length of time, <a href=\"/courses/babypillars-sleep-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">there are several techniques a parent can use in order to encourage them to go to sleep</a>. Taking care of the baby basics, making sure the baby has been fed a good amount, making sure the baby is wearing a clean diaper, and making sure the baby is in a comfortable position as well as a safe setting, is a great way to start a bedtime routine.</p>\n<p>In the event that you are unsure of the baby’s progress in this area, feel free to <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health\" title=\"Mayo Clinic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consult your doctor</a> for insights into your baby’s health. Since every child is different, it can be hard to expect what will happen down to the smallest details. However, remember that it is part of the learning and growing phase, and while it can be unpleasant and arduous, it is rewarding and a special time for you as a parent.</p>",

Once babies are born, their smile is a reflex, mostly when they are content or they are passing gas. However, as time goes on and they begin to interact with you and others, they begin to smile intentionally to show their happiness or delight in response to stimuli. This is why smiling in babies more often is noted as between a month and a half to three months of age; more parents are looking for the baby to smile out of happiness, rather than as a reflex.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>When Do Babies Smile?</h2>\n<h2>When Your Baby Smiles: An Introductory Overview</h2>\n<p>There is nothing like seeing your child smile for the first time. The magic of the moment is something that will stay inside of your heart forever. It is also a social development skill that demonstrates happiness and an awareness of life that produces happiness. That is part of the reason that many parents are more than excited to see their baby’s first smile.</p>\n<p>However, when a baby smiles, especially a <a href=\"/0-3-months-baby\">newborn baby</a>, it does not immediately correspond to the state of his or her happiness. It could easily mean that the baby is relaxed or falling asleep, rather than happy. The baby’s smile is considered a reflex early on, but as your baby grows and begins to recognize social cues, her ability to smile goes from involuntary to a specific response to the appropriate stimulus. There are several key factors that smiling demonstrates, all of which are good signs for your baby’s developmental journey as a whole. Smiling’s benefits include a variety of social, emotional, and physical development.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">Since smiling is one of the first milestones, and it happens relatively quickly after birth</a>, many parents see it as a good sign. Early days for new parents especially are fraught with concerns over diapers, <a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">breastfeed</a>ing and bottles, safety issues, and new and interrupted routines. Smiles from our darling children seem to cast light onto some of the shadows of parenthood. In the event that your baby does not reach the milestone for smiling before the end of the fourth month, there are very few instances where the cause for concern goes to the extremes.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Smile?</h2>\n<h2>The Signs and Benefits of a Baby Smiling</h2>\n<p>When your baby begins to smile, right after you have given birth, you will find it more of a reflex. There are several potential causes behind their smiles at this point. However, <a href=\"/blog/parenting-tips/\">once your baby gives you an intention smile, given of his or her own volition</a>, it is a sign that your baby has developed in a number of significant ways; this includes showing you, as the parent, that your baby’s skills have increased on a social, emotional, physical, and visual basis.</p>\n<p>Smiling is a social conditioning to show pleasure. In smiling back of his or her own choice, your baby has demonstrated that he or she knows when to smile. Can you imagine babies smiling when they are mad? I have never seen that happen. Parents during the first few weeks of their baby’s life will be smiling down at their baby. The baby’s visual development has increased enough to where he has been able to see you smiling enough that he has observed both when you are smiling, and why you are smiling. He mimics you as a result. Some parents will lean in really close to the baby’s face so he or she is able to see the parent’s face clearly. This is one way that babies may learn to smile faster. Their eyes have to focus in on objects that are nearby in order to see them clearly at first. As they grow, they are better able to see things, especially familiar things, such as a mother’s face, from further away. The eyes are also helpful in allowing the parent to see the difference between a smile that is a reflex and a smile that is genuinely given in response; the eyes will reflect their cogitative state. When babies smile as a reflex, it is often with their eyes closed, as many are drifting off to sleep or they are tooting gas involuntarily. By looking into a baby’s eyes, you will be able to see their happiness, which will likely influence your own.</p>\n<p>Because of this emotional connection, seeing your child smile for the first time will allow you to <a href=\"/blog/baby-milestones-month-by-month-for-the-first-year/\">see that he has grown mentally as well</a>. Emotional development will aid in the baby’s ability to connect to other people emotionally, greatly benefiting them in the long run.</p>\n<p>Coupled with the benefits is just seeing the physical reaction, too. Physical development, including the muscles in the baby’s face that are required for smiling, is always something to be excited about in babies.</p>\n<p>The last benefit of seeing a child smile of their own intention is to see that they have developed a sense of sociality. No matter where people go, they will always need to be able to communicate with other people in order to survive and be happy. A baby, seeing her mother or father smile down at her, will be able to pick up on the affection and pleasure behind the movement. In reciprocating this act, she is further able to respond to their message.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Start Smileing</h2>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/when-do-babies-smile-3-month-old-baby-on-back-scaled-e1629106328225.jpg\" alt=\"baby smile on mat\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Encouraging Your Baby to Smile</h2>\n<p>If you see a newborn baby smiling, chances are the baby is smiling not because he is happy. It is more than likely that the baby is smiling because he is gassy, he is urinating, or he is comfortable. It is easy to begin encouraging your baby to smile, and it is easy to keep trying to get him to smile as time goes on, too.</p>\n<p>During the first month and a half to three months, there are many things that you can do to try to get your son or daughter to smile. <a href=\"/blog/baby-communication-tips/\">Talking to a baby, cooing over her, and smiling frequently at her will encourage her to smile back</a>. Once she does it, she will be further encouraged to smile based on your response. Likely, as any happy parent will tell you, you will be amazed and happy, and in showing your response to her response, you will continue to stroke that impulse to smile when she sees you.</p>\n<p>There are other ways to get your baby to smile. I had a friend whose one daughter would “encourage” her baby sister to smile by using her thumbs to push her mouth into a smile-like position. Even though the younger sister would not smile as a result, the adults thought it was pretty humorous, as did her older sister. Many times, parents will tickle their baby, trying to get them to smile and eventually to laugh. There are other things you can do to help get your baby to smile; singing a favorite lullaby, making faces, using a toy to play with him, and reading to him can also help your baby smile. The best thing to do is to do your best in finding out what makes him happy. Once you have that figured out, getting him to smile is no problem. That is why many babies will smile up at their moms and dads; their parents make them happy, even when they are just looking at them.</p>\n<h2>Things to Watch</h2>\n<p>A delay in smiling is nothing to be concerned about in itself. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI_YpzHA_kQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This is true for all the baby’s milestones</a>. It is only when a child exhibits more than one delay, or specific delays together, when there is a significant concern. Many parents, failing to see their child smiling, will be concerned for its health. When a child has not smiled on his or her own, prompted by social cues, this is one of the signs that your baby might be on the <a href=\"/special-needs-baby/autism-in-babies\">autism spectrum</a>. However, a delay like this is something that must be taken into consideration from a broad perspective. A delay in smiling could indicate a more serious temperament or personality; the desire to smile is not there. It also could be a sign that the baby had not made the connection between happiness and smiling, but rather sees something else as a way to express his or her happiness; some babies, for example, will gurgle instead of smile.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of going to the doctor to ask questions if you are concerned with the delay in smiling is that your doctor will likely be able to give you good resources. Many parents are concerned if their baby does not smile within the first month, and because of the various check-ups with doctors, it can be hard to know when exactly a baby smiles on average. Doctors should be able to hand out a good pamphlet or chart to show the approximation of several milestones. Being aware of realistic expectations is the first step to preventing a new parent from being worried. I know this from firsthand experience. When your baby sees other babies at daycare, it is hard to get a good estimate of where exactly your child fits in his or her development. Because of this, it is easy to assume your child is way ahead of everyone else, or to wonder if she is lagging behind.</p>\n<p>In the event that you do have a concern about your baby’s delay in smiling, it is best to see your family doctor or a <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/\" title=\"AAP HealthyChildren.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pediatrician</a>. If there are other concerns about your child’s health or mental well-being, your doctor is the best person to be able to point you in the right direction. Finding answers on the Internet can be tricky at best and misleading at worst; having a good relationship with a doctor can really help, especially for things such as this.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Smile?</h2>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Who doesn’t love to see a baby smiling? Baby smiles are one of the things that makes parenting seem easier. All parents love the comfort of knowing that their child enjoys them, and that is why many parents begin to look for smiles early on. Smiling on a voluntary level should happen between the first six to twelve weeks, or the first month and a half to the third month.</p>\n<p>Smiling easily shows parents that their baby, besides being adorably cute, is developing his social skills, working on her emotional development, and gaining insight into the world around them. Parents should know that there is a large variety of ways to make their babies smile, and eventually laugh. During the first months that they have together, it is highly likely a parent will be able to find and tap into a way to make their baby smile happily. However, it should be noted that there are things you can do if you are concerned about your baby’s development, including going to the doctor or getting support from your group of mommy and daddy friends. You will find that many concerns about delayed development will often show more than one sign; however, a close relationship with your doctor has many benefits.</p>\n<p>As parents, we all look for a sign we are on the right track, and our best efforts (and even sometimes our less than spectacular ones) are bearing fruit. We want to see that our babies loves us just as much as we love them. We definitely live to see them smile.</p>\n<p><em><strong>When did your baby started to smile? was there any delay in you baby smiling patterns? how cute was he of she? let us know in the comments below.</strong></em></p><p style=\"margin-top:1.5em\"><strong>Ready to support your baby’s development?</strong> <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">Explore the BabyPillars program</a>, milestone-based guidance for every stage.</p>",

Motherhood is a like a special travel destination, one that has been on the travel books for years before the planning even begins. Your child is a soft, warm bundle of breath and joy, full of fanfare and music–music the baby can’t really read yet. So it is natural, as children and their parents never see eye to eye on taste in music, that the baby’s crying/singing will eventually grate your nerves.</p>\n<p>So many people have different methods and swear by certain actions on <a href=\"/blog/25-reasons-why-your-baby-will-not-stop-crying-and-what-should-you-do-differently/\">how to get a baby or toddler to stop crying</a>. As a mother, I’ve found some things will work for my kids and others won’t, and sometimes they will but not all the time. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzzqwmJJEfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What you need to do differently, in order to get a baby to stop crying</a>, is to start with your own attitude. You can’t take care of the baby if you are having a hard time controlling yourself. Mothers are hypersensitive, likely somewhat sleep-deprived, and emotionally struggling to feel confident, beautiful, and lovable. A baby crying can easily upset any calm façade a mother will employ.</p>\n<p>I think a lot of mothers skip this step, because it was one I had to learn on my own (once you get pregnant, everyone you know tells you what to do and even strangers feel compelled to give you advice.) Since learning it, I cannot express the importance of it enough. Once you’ve given yourself a moment to breathe, think properly, and plan ahead, you can more easily assimilate yourself into the kind of mother your baby or toddler needs in order to stop crying.</p>\n<p>I think it is especially frightening when the crying baby is a newborn. <a href=\"/blog/baby-milestones-month-by-month-for-the-first-year/\">When the baby comes, it is just so small and fragile. You feel so big and strong and scary</a>. All the hormones are leaving your body, but they still want to scare you and sadden you as much as possible on the way out, and a <a href=\"/0-3-months-baby\">newborn baby</a> crying will send your body into “alert mode” at the least provocation. I remember when I had my daughter, I heard her crying and, in addition to the rush of milk running down my front, I also had adrenaline spiking my blood. </p>\n<p>Even now, about six months later, when she cries, I still feel a slight hesitation, like I’ve done something wrong by letting her cry in the first place. That’s where I have to check my own attitude, make my plans, and set about following the path I’ve focused my mind on pursuing. I’ve found it is important to do this, because if you don’t have a plan for how to handle yourself while you are trying to get your child to stop crying, it can easy escalate into you crying. Mentally prepping yourself can really help out when it comes to dealing with your emotions, especially if you get increasingly frustrated by your child’s crying.</p>\n<h2><span>Baby crying sounds</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/\">One of the first things I learned as a new mother with my son</a>, who is a toddler now, was to listen for the different types of sounds the baby makes when she cries. A baby will quickly learn to differentiate his or her cries to match what they want. I was relieved to find this out, because that meant I could figure out what my baby wanted, and I could probably learn to do it quickly enough I could get my baby to stop crying in a matter of mere minutes.</p>\n<p>Another thing I learned pretty quickly is how disappointing my own expectations were in preparing me for motherhood; while I still like to try to learn new tricks, I’ve found trial and error will work better, more often than not. Still, I have my checklist, and I start with the innate needs, and work out to the most frivolous needs.</p>\n<p>Everybody needs food. When my baby cries, the first thing I check for is if she is hungry. Food has a funny way of making all of us happy. Whether you <a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">breastfeed</a> or bottlefeed (either way, both have their perks), getting some food into the baby is a great way to see if they are hungry.</p>\n<p>You can also feel their stomach to see if their tummy is ‘empty’ by taking two fingers and gently massaging the stomach area in a circular motion. If the stomach area feels harder as you gently push downward, it means the stomach is full (This also helps let you know if the baby has a bowel movement coming.) If it is softer and more pliant, your baby’s stomach is empty.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/baby-crying-baby-refuses-to-switch-to-a-bottle-scaled-e1628775456501.jpg\" alt=\"baby crying in hands\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Crying And Sleep</h2>\n<p>The next thing is sleep. Babies aren’t always so willing to just go to sleep of course, so they have to be tricked into going to sleep. Depending on your baby, that could mean a lot of things. For my son, when we got his sonogram, we saw that he had his hand in his mouth, so if he had trouble sleeping, I got him a pacifier. For my daughter, she would go to sleep when I was walking, so I usually hand her off to my husband to <a href=\"/blog/5-steps-for-a-better-quitter-night-sleep/\">cradle her and walk her around until she relaxes enough to sleep</a>.I think this is where most parents use Google for ideas, when they are stuck wondering how to get a baby to stop crying and go to sleep. Both my husband’s parents and my own said a great way to get babies to go to sleep was to put them in the car seat and go for a drive.</p>\n<p>When I am out running errands now, I can see this is true; my baby girl, whether she is crying or not, will eventually stop crying and go to sleep if I am driving around. Rocking is always a favorite; walking them around is a similar one. I’ve tried singing and swaying at different volumes and speeds; I’ve often handed the babies off to their daddy, because he’s got stronger arms and doesn’t smell like breastmilk, and he’ll put them to sleep.</p>\n<p>I’ve used pacifiers and blankets and teddy bears. I’ve lain down next to them, and I’ve let them lay on me as I cuddle with them. I’ve elevated beds and used a bed massager. I have also turned on music and twinkling lights, and most of my electric bill after my son was born was for his swing. All of these are great tricks to see if you can get them to work; very few of these on my list have consistently worked in putting my kids to sleep.</p>\n<p>More often than not, the kids have just wanted me around; those are the methods which have worked the best for me.</p>\n<p>I was a lucky mom in this area; my daughter’s sleeping habits have not changed much since she was a newborn to when she was an infant.</p>\n<p>If it is not food or sleep, I go onto the next critical need for babies: excrement. Behold, the diaper. Sometimes I can smell it first, and it slaps my nose around to make sure I jump ahead on the checklist. But if I can’t smell it, checking the diaper is usually third on my list. Change diaper, check temperament, and see if crying will stop. That’s step three.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/newborn-tips-and-facts/\">From newborn to infant, food, sleep, and diapers pretty much top the list</a>. But there are more specific cries that happen as time goes on. My daughter will cry for me, or she will cry for my husband now. </p>\n<p>She will cry if she wants to move, or if she is bored. She will also cry if she can’t reach something, since she is beginning to try crawling and she isn’t entirely enchanted with the idea. Noticing this is a complement to the first rule. </p>\n<p>Check yourself first, and then check your baby. As a mother, you know what your baby needs better than anyone else (usually) and if you don’t know what they need, you’re the one with the most incentive in the world to learn, and you are willing to do so.</p>\n<p>This skill, this inborn idea of wanting to meet our kids’ needs, can be subtle. But I really see it now, with two kids. When my daughter cries, I know what she wants, and when my son cried when he was her age, I knew what he wanted. They aren’t so different, but they are different enough I easily know the differences. If you know your child, after so much time, what they want when they are crying becomes second nature to you.</p>\n<p>My son is just over a year and a half older than my daughter. When my son is crying, and I have a crying toddler on my hands rather than a crying baby, I have to approach the situation differently. After all, my son is pretty good about not crying for food anymore, which he really shouldn’t anyway since he is more than capable of getting his own food on his own (I woke up one morning after buying a bunch of bananas the previous night to see he’d pulled at least two of them out of their peels when I wasn’t looking), but when he is tired, he starts to get more grumpy and more likely to cry.</p>\n<p>Since he is two, he has figured out he doesn’t like to sleep at naptime, so naptime is a battlefield imperative. I live for the days when I am driving to Grandma’s house and he falls asleep in the car.</p>\n<p>But when he wakes up in the middle of the night, things have to happen differently. He sleeps in his own big boy bed in his own room, so when he wakes up at night, he’ll often cry because I am not there with him. I was never a light sleeper until I had kids. I’ve found if I wake up right as he begins to cry, I’ll have a much easier time putting him back down.</p>\n<p>This usually translates into me getting him some teething tablets (I use the homeopathic ones for him and his sister), re-tucking him in his covers with his favorite blanket, and sitting with him for a moment to make sure his sleep resumes. If he has been crying longer by the time I’ve reached him, he will need much more before he goes <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/safe-sleep/\" title=\"AAP Safe Sleep Guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">back to sleep</a>.</p>\n<p>When he cries like this, it is always louder and more emotionally charging for me; I feel like he woke up from a nightmare, so I will pick him up, rock him on my lap, cuddle up with him and snuggle until he falls back asleep, or pulling him into my bed so he won’t cry anymore.</p>\n<p>In the event you have done all you can, and your baby is still crying, you need to revert back to the first item on our checklist here. You need to take care of yourself. I know plenty of mothers who have had all sorts of trouble with crying babies, but we had to learn, at that point, to take a moment for ourselves.</p>\n<p>Step out of the room, take a bathroom break (I always liked doing this one because it felt less like I was avoiding my kids when they were crying), and try to keep calm. When you are tired, stressed, and emotionally frazzled, you need to recollect yourself. So many parents will say that giving birth was the easy part, and I will only argue with them there if a guy said it.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Your baby will have beautiful eyes, regardless of their color. While many parents long for a specific color or shade, your child will easily wear his or her eyes and make them fit his or her own style. From nine months to a year after they are born, our babies have a lot of changing that is going on inside of them and around them.</p>\n<p>During this time, we can eagerly wait for those changes and record them as they grow, and this includes the changing of the irises to their final colors. Some babies may require more time for their eyes to finish changing, with some changing after two or even three years, but it is not likely that the main colors of their eyes will change after the one-year mark.</p>\n<p>The best way to guess your baby’s final colors is to take a good look at the biological make-up of the grandparents from both parents, and then to compare them to the parents and others in the family tree. If you are not sure of the health or state of your baby’s eyes, the best thing to do is schedule an appointment with your baby’s regular doctor. Your baby’s <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/\" title=\"AAP HealthyChildren.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pediatrician</a> can easily check for other areas of concern that might be affecting the baby’s eyes, such as jaundice, and have your doctor recommend an eye doctor or specialist depending on what they find.<em><strong>Please write your thoughts and comments in the comments section below.</strong></em></p><p style=\"margin-top:1.5em\"><strong>Ready to support your baby’s development?</strong> <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">Explore the BabyPillars program</a>, milestone-based guidance for every stage.</p>",

    htmlContent: "<blockquote><p>Eyes come in a myriad of different colors, all ranging from blue to green, to brown and black, and every shade in between. It is with good reason that it has been said that the eyes are said to be the window to the soul. When it comes to babies, many parents look for the day when the color of the eyes is fully known. Many babies are commonly born with blue eyes, and their iris colors will change over the first year of their lives. The final changes will be around six to nine months of age, but there are some babies whose eyes do not change until well after the one-year mark. This is largely due to the many changes that take place at the time of birth, and the ones which will continue to change as the baby grows older. Genetics of the biological parents will play the most influence over the final color of your baby’s eyes.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>When Do Babies Eyes Change Color</h2>\n<h3>Your Baby’s Eyes: A Brief Overview of Anatomy</h3>\n<p>The colored part of the eye is known as the iris, and its color relies on three genetic markers. While science is developing fast, not all is known about all of these genes, so it is still impossible to predict your baby’s eyes until he or she is out of the womb. <a href=\"/blog/infant-growth-spurts-what-does-it-mean-what-to-do/\">As the baby grows, the muscles strengthen</a>, including the muscle which dilates the pupil, the black part in the middle of the eye. As the baby’s muscles develop, this muscle will pull the iris as the pupils dilate, and it will contract the iris when the eye is relaxed or in darker atmospheres. This is part of the reason that even as a child and an adult, people’s eyes can change shades; as the iris is contracted or expanded, the color can change depending on the emotional response. The white part of the eye, the sclera, is may also have a blueish tint when the baby is born, but this will go away as the baby gets more time out of the womb.</p>\n<h3>Changing Colors in the Eye: An Introductory Overview</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">When a baby is born, the baby’s body is still going through a lot of changes as they exit the womb to a world where they are independent of their mother’s body</a>. One of the more significant changes can be seen in the changing colors of the baby’s eyes. Babies are often born with bluer eyes when they are born, and this is largely due to the absence of melanin in their bodies. Melanin is a pigment that is present in many parts of the human body, and can determine colors in hair, skin, and the eyes. It is made in the baby’s body once the child is exposed to light. </p>\n<p>The melanin is the only pigment that is present in the eye, so everyone has a blue base, but the top color will change if there is more melanin produced as the baby ages, darkening the final color until it gets to the darkest shade of brown. Once the baby exits the womb and is able to develop the melanin on its own, the baby’s eyes will gradually change from a blueish color. Of course, should the genetics of the parents point to blue eyes, it is entirely possible that the child’s eyes will not change from blue, and in many cases, even then, the blue will either get lighter or darker.</p>\n<p>Genetics are the biggest factor in determining what color your baby’s eyes are when they finish changing. It is by looking to the biological parents of the babies that the best guess will be established, until the baby’s eyes finally stop changing. Many people will cite that mutations for the eye color can change, and while that is true, there are no less than three genetic markers for eye color, and the change of the mutation happening to all of the genes is very, very slim.</p>\n<p>However, it is also important to keep in mind that because of the various genes that will code for eye color, there is a possibility the grandparents and previous generations will also have an influence on the final color of your baby’s eyes. Sometimes, specific genes can skip a generation, including eye color. If there is a grandparent who has blue eyes, and both parents have brown eyes, it is still possible that the baby will have blue eyes.</p>\n<p>Just like the rest of the baby’s body, the eye’s melanin production can take some time to work out and level off. This is part of the reason that it takes a longer time for the eyes to settle; while the color is generally set by the end of nine months, some parents have noted changes later than one year, but they are smaller changes by that time; it is extremely unlikely that the base color will change from blue to brown, and then go back to blue, for example.</p>\n<p>Because of the differences in color and genetics, it may take a different amount of time for babies’ eyes to fully change. Sometimes it does not take long at all; My own children fall into this category, since both of them have blue eyes. However, while they both have blue eyes, my son’s blue eyes are darker blue, while my daughter’s eyes are lighter blue. They were both born with blue eyes, but my son’s became darker while my daughter’s faded into a lighter blue. I have a friend who has dark brown eyes; her baby was late, so when her daughter was born, she had dark blue eyes, but it didn’t take long before her daughter’s eyes were as dark as her mother’s eyes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-questions-and-answers/\">However, it can take between nine months to a year</a> before parents see a consistent shade of color shining back at them. This is more common with darker eyes, because of the pigmentation and its patterning; it is also more frequently seen in hazel eyes, where the pigmentation is more scattered and the gene marker which codes for the color is less understood as the others.</p>\n<p>The possibility of changing colors after nine months is very rare, though not unheard of. Some children have been observed with changing eye color up until the age of six. Once more, in determining how long it will take for your child’s eyes to settle into their final color, genetics will play a significant role; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSJ2lj6yLXM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">however, each child is different, so it is best to keep track of it and to be on the lookout for signs of trouble</a>.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/when-do-babies-eyes-change-color-baby-eyes-blue-change-color-scaled-e1629213882734.jpg\" alt=\"baby eyes blue change color\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h3>What to Expect</h3>\n<p>When your baby is born, there will likely be a blueish tint to the eyes, if they are not completely blue already. Many children who end up with brown eyes have dark blue eyes at birth, or a blueish shade to them, though some babies can be born with dark eyes that look black. As the baby grows from an infant into a toddler, the color change will become more permanent. As your baby’s body develops and their systems are more regulated, think about how they eat, sleep, and poop on more regular schedules as they grow, compared to when they are first born, their eye color will have enough melanin produced in the eye that guessing the final color will be easier.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/infant-growth-spurts-what-does-it-mean-what-to-do/\">The baby has a significant growth spurt around six months of age</a>, as its body gets ready to begin to move around more. This is around the time where the melanin build up has accumulated enough where you should see some difference in your baby’s eyes since he was born. </p>\n<p>As the melanin has developed and been stored, the baby’s eyes will have changed along with it. It only take a little for the melanin to change the blue to green, green to hazel, and hazel to brown or even black. The more melanin that the body is told to produce by the genes, the more it is likely it will take longer for your baby’s eyes to change, though that is not necessarily the case. More babies with dark eyes at birth have been reported with changes up to three years after birth, but once more, this is not necessarily the case.</p>\n<p>The milestone marker for your baby’s eyes to settle into their final color sets the expectation that their eyes will finish changing around nine months. Whether blue-eyed or dark-eyed, it is likely that the baby’s eyes will begin to slow down and settle into their final color around this time, though it can easily take longer than that.</p>\n<h3>When to Consult Your Baby’s Doctor</h3>\n<p>Eyes are one of the easier ways to see if there is anything wrong with a baby. If the baby’s eyes look milky white at some point, or if the baby’s eyes develop into two different colors, it is important to <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health\" title=\"Mayo Clinic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consult your doctor</a>. In general, if you are not sure your baby’s eyes are developing in a normal manner, then you can schedule an appointment with your child’s doctor, or you can request information on an eye doctor. Many children will go to the eye doctor when they are toddlers, so if you want to go early because you are not sure of a possible issue, try to find a doctor that you will be able to work with in the long term.</p>\n<p>Any eye color in the irises can change later on in life, due to some diseases or other issues, including aging. That’s another good reason to make sure you have a good eye doctor available to your child, and why getting your baby a check-up can only help you in the long run. After your baby is born, one change that the sclera, the white part of the eye, may show is a yellowish tint; this can hint at jaundice. Most pediatricians will immediately recognize this as a build-up of bilirubin, and that has to be treated differently than an eye doctor would be able to treat it.</p>\n<p>Another issue that comes up sometimes with baby’s eyes is with the camera flash. More cameras are able to pick up tumors on the back of the baby’s eyes. This is seen in pictures where the one eye is glowing white, and it consistently shows up as a bright spot on the child’s eye in pictures taken with a digital camera. This could be a sign of tumors or cancer, so it is important to get to a doctor that will be able to carefully examine your baby’s eyes for any inconsistencies.</p>\n<h3>When Do Babies Eyes Change Color?</h3>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Your baby will have beautiful eyes, regardless of their color. While many parents long for a specific color or shade, your child will easily wear his or her eyes and make them fit his or her own style. From nine months to a year after they are born, our babies have a lot of changing that is going on inside of them and around them. During this time, we can eagerly wait for those changes and record them as they grow, and this includes the changing of the irises to their final colors. Some babies may require more time for their eyes to finish changing, with some changing after two or even three years, but it is not likely that the main colors of their eyes will change after the one-year mark.</p>\n<p>The best way to guess your baby’s final colors is to take a good look at the biological make-up of the grandparents from both parents, and then to compare them to the parents and others in the family tree. If you are not sure of the health or state of your baby’s eyes, the best thing to do is schedule an appointment with your baby’s regular doctor. Your baby’s <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/\" title=\"AAP HealthyChildren.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pediatrician</a> can easily check for other areas of concern that might be affecting the baby’s eyes, such as jaundice, and have your doctor recommend an eye doctor or specialist depending on what they find.</p><p style=\"margin-top:1.5em\"><strong>Ready to support your baby’s development?</strong> <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">Explore the BabyPillars program</a>, milestone-based guidance for every stage.</p>",

Cradling in particular is a position in which you hold your baby in a way that supports him or her from head to toe. Personally, I found this to be a natural way to hold a resting newborn. Cradling isn’t just for newborns, though – <a href=\"/courses/\">it is an important activity throughout a baby’s first few years</a>.</p>\n<p>Cradling a baby has many benefits and potentially long lasting results, which range from affecting baby development in a positive manner, to assisting in feeding, and so much more. You can think of cradling as similar to being told to sit up straight or to have good posture – it’s something that we know we should do, but sometimes need a reminder to do, as well. Sometimes new parents do not realize the benefits of holding their baby in a particular way, or may try something a limited number of times and give up on it, instead of developing a consistent pattern. Cradling may sometimes be one of those things, but after you realize all of the reasons to be intentional about cradling, you will be better able to implement – and enjoy – carrying your child in this position into your daily activities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Cradling Does</h2>\n<p>Cradling is thought to aid in a newborn’s development by creating for them a sense of security. The physical benefits are seen in motor skills development, as the arms are free – yet the body is secure. A baby who spends time in the cradling position can, then, play with her hands, and reach for her parent’s face. Along the same lines, there are benefits in social and language development, as it is an easy position in which the infant can see the parent’s face and interact. <a href=\"/blog/5-steps-for-a-better-quitter-night-sleep/\" target=\"_blank\">Cradling a baby can be used as a calming method, and for some babies, this can aid in, and often does result in, falling asleep</a>. This is because the baby is able to relax in this full body, supportive position.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Cradle Hold Vs. Cross Cradle Hold</h2>\n<p>Perhaps you are wondering how to cradle a baby correctly. It sounds basic, and really, it is. The cradle hold and the cross cradle hold are similar, but each makes use of the caretaker’s arms slightly differently. One similarity is that both positions require both arms to be engaged.</p>\n<p>The cradle hold involves the baby’s head resting in the crook of your arm, with that same arm’s forearm and hand supporting her back as far down as possible, and then the other arm supports the baby’s bottom. This arm also will support the baby’s knees and legs. The baby is parallel to the ground in this position, but, as you will feel, his back will slightly curve.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the cross cradle hold uses the arm opposite of the baby’s head to hold his or her neck, supporting and controlling the head, as well. Then, the arm that is closer to the baby’s head crosses over and is used to support his or her bottom. This may provide an extra secure feeling for some babies.</p>\n<p>The goal, of course, for both positions is a fully supported feeling for the baby. This physical support enables a baby to relax, and encourages positive emotions to be experienced and associated with being held.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Tips for Cradling</h2>\n<p>Cradling doesn’t necessarily have an optimal age limit; this position can be comforting for as long as you naturally hold your child. This extends through the toddler ages. Some babies may become so active that they cannot be cradled for quite as long or often, but the benefits of having done so, or even attempting to keep doing so, may remain.</p>\n<p>Holding your baby’s outer elbow in the cradling position enhances the experience, as his or her arm is not dangling to the side. (The arm closest to you will be pressed upon by your body, so that it is not dangling, either.) Holding the arm at the elbow still allows for some movement, and you may observe your baby calmly exploring her hands, which may rest closely together in this position.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/infant-growth-spurts-what-does-it-mean-what-to-do/\">Cradling can be a great relief to an overstimulated infant</a>, whether the overstimulation is due to a crowd, too many toys with sounds and lights, other (perhaps older) children playing, or even a family pet that is excessively engaged at the time. It allows the baby to focus on just one face, and perhaps just that person’s voice if he or she is using it to soothe the child while in the cradle hold. Talking to, singing to, and moving with your baby while you hold her in this position can add to the overall experience.</p>\n<p>Much to our overly connected chagrin, cradling isn’t being done properly if you are holding a phone, the remote, or trying to work on something else; it is about focusing on your baby, and since your baby is focusing on you, he will notice the difference if you are distracted or disengaged, especially as he becomes older. Cradling doesn’t need to be done every moment – and neither does your phone need to be checked every moment, despite that flashing light or notification sound – and the importance of a few moments of pause with your baby should outweigh any incoming emails or text messages.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Facts About Cradling</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cradling doesn’t take any extra equipment, money, or time to set up! It’s just about you and your baby.</li>\n<li>The cradle hold is natural, and mimics the position and form a baby has in the womb.</li>\n<li>Cradling supports the baby’s entire spine when done properly.</li>\n<li>A baby who is fully supported along her whole back and body feels safe and secure.</li>\n<li>A baby can enjoy being cradled by any parent or caretaker, not just a breastfeeding mother.</li>\n<li>You can cradle a baby anytime, anywhere.</li>\n<li>Your baby may come to look forward to being cradled.</li>\n<li>You are creating a good habit of taking the time to spend actual face time with your little one when you cradle him.</li>\n<li>Cradling your baby often does not spoil your baby.</li>\n<li>Cradling just may become one of your favorite memories with your little one!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/baby-cradling-important-baby-cradeling-tips-and-more-scaled-e1629213350411.jpg\" alt=\"baby cradling tips and more\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Common Tendencies in Women and Cradling</h2>\n<p>Another interesting fact is: most women cradle to the left. While speculations in the past have attributed this to most women being right handed, so this position would be freeing the dominant hand – the study by Victoria Bourne and Dr Brenda Todd attributes this instead to the way the human brain processes information, specifically that of emotional behaviors. According to this study, that information goes to the right side of the brain, which is known to be connected most directly with the left side of the body. This connection explains why even most left-handed women hold their babies on the left – to observe their facial expressions and in turn, their constantly changing wants and needs – despite the potential loss of productivity that would occur from occupying their dominant side.</p>\n<p>This also explains the studies from England and Switzerland which attempted to link how a mother holds her child and her emotional health; the studies linked stressed out, depressed women, or those on the verge of depression, to being most likely to hold their babies in the crook of their right arms, as opposed to the seemingly more natural way of holding babies in their left arms. This would seem to imply there is a disassociation or lack of a proper connection between a woman and her baby’s needs and emotional responses during a time of great stress or depression. This is extremely important, as this stress and disconnection could be mirrored in a baby’s emotional development if left uncared for.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Nursing and Cradling</h2>\n<p>The cradle hold, as well as the cross cradle hold, can also be used during breastfeeding, although it will look a little different. Instead of the baby being held parallel to the ground, the baby is held facing the mother’s body. When nursing with a cover, the cradle hold was the easiest and most effective position for me; it gave my baby the ability to focus, and relaxed her even if we were in a loud environment, such as a restaurant or another public place. It also allows for a baby to easily fall asleep at the end of a nursing session, which was often the case with my little one.</p>\n<p>The cross cradle hold actually gives you more control over your infant’s head, which can be more useful when guiding an especially young, or fussy baby during feedings. I found the cross cradle technique to be harder the longer – and more active – my baby became. Even so, it was great in the beginning when we were working on her latch. If your baby has a lot of head control early on, you may find her fighting the cross cradle hold in an attempt to independently direct her head. If she can latch well, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHE6pcMsYFE\" target=\"_blank\">switching to the cradle hold may be more comfortable</a>.</p>\n<p>While there are several other great nursing positions, including those that are even taught in hospitals and by lactation consultants, these two positions more so ensure that the baby stays in proper alignment and is at an optimal angle for feeding. As mentioned above, in both of these nursing positions, the baby should face the mother’s stomach, with his shoulders aligned with his hips, as well as his head, and knees, which will be slightly bent. Your baby may try to press his feet against something nearby, completing the alignment through the rest of his legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Find more info from parents directly on Reddit:</strong><a href=\"http:// https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">/r/beyondthebump</a> | <strong><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span>/r/NewParents/</span></a></strong> | <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">/r/Parenting/</a></p>\n<h2>Baby Development</h2>\n<p>As you can see, holding a baby in a cradle hold has numerous potential benefits and a whole range of usefulness. From the most awkward new father, to the breastfeeding mother, to the most experienced grandmother, there is no one who cannot cradle a baby if they try. Cradling a baby before sleep, or simply holding a baby in the cradle or cross cradle hold, is definitely something that should be considered and consistently used in the raising of a calm, secure feeling child. <a href=\"/blog/baby-milestones-month-by-month-for-the-first-year/\">While every baby hits newborn milestones at different slightly different ages</a>, it is wise and natural to want to do everything possible to encourage proper baby development, including regularly making use of the cradling technique.</p>\n<p>If you are unsure about how to cradle a baby properly during nursing, seeking a lactation consultant or nurse who works with infants is a great option. Often there are a certain number of times you can see a consultant for free – check your insurance policy. This will allow you to feel confident about how to cradle your baby properly. You may also receive advice about particular milestones from your health care provider if you are concerned about motor skills, social skills, and language development, among other baby development issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Creating an environment where a baby is assured he has your focused attention, can focus his attention on you, and does not feel bombarded by all of the other potential stimuli he will eventually become used to, will ensure he can learn and grow in his own way, and at his own pace. Encouraging your baby to periodically relax throughout the day, and at nursing sessions if applicable (which can be quite stressful at first for new moms), will encourage less stress and anxiety for your child as he becomes older, potentially even on through adulthood. As you teach your baby about the world, you will want him to feel safe and secure when he is close to you, and cradling allows him to do so.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What do you think about the cradling positions?

    htmlContent: "<h2>Babies Roll Over – Freequently Asked:</h2>\n<h1>Complete Parents Video Guides to Rolling Over</h1>\n<blockquote><p>Babies learn to roll over when they are around five months old. They can do this as early as four months from their tummies to their backs, and as late as six months on average. At six months, the child’s muscles and coordination will likely have improved enough that the baby is able to roll from back to tummy, as well as from his or her tummy to the back. Parents can often determine if their child is ready to roll over based on the baby’s ability to hold his head up and play on his back or tummy for several minutes.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>When Do Babies Roll Over? The Complete Parents Guide.</h2>\n<h3>Rolling Over: An Introductory Overview</h3>\n<p>Rolling over is an action that requires more muscular coordination and more strength than many of the movements that several early milestones. For a baby to choose to roll over intentionally, he also has to have enough confidence and intentionality to make the necessary maneuvers. Many times, as the baby nears the age of 5 months, you will be able to identify several signs that the baby is ready to roll over, including growing muscle strength and an increasing interest in fun activities. You may also see several opportunities to help your baby learn to move on his or her own, and you will begin to recognize any potential barriers to reaching this milestone.</p>\n<p>With this particular action, most of the requirements will be on a physical level. If your baby can lift his head, if your baby can begin to look side to side while on her forearms, your baby is nearing the time when rolling over is coming. If you think of the baby’s body and its many muscles, there are a lot of different muscles groups which will need to be strong before rolling over is possible. Since the baby’s birth, he has been learning to use different muscles. By four months, he is able to have more control over his body and the movements. Because <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slVqi6UWkYQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rolling over requires momentum, especially in considering moving from the back to the tummy</a>, this factor will also be critical.</p>\n<p>Rolling over usually starts from the babies’ moving from their tummies to their backs. By the time that the babies can roll from their backs to their tummies, they have much more motor control over their body and much more confidence in their ability to make decisions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-roll-over/\">While the average time for babies to roll over is from four months to six months</a>, some babies will roll over as early as three months. You can see this more often in babies who were born past their original due date. The same is true of later rollers; more often, <a href=\"/blog/premature-baby-care\">preemie</a> babies will usually roll over a bit later as they develop more skills and their bodies grow more. It is also important to acknowledge that some babies do not roll over at all. This milestone can be skipped over. Never fear, though, skipping this milestone alone is not any indicator for worry.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Roll Over? The Complete Parents Guide.</h2>\n<h3>Signs Your Baby is Ready to Roll Over</h3>\n<p>It is not unusual for a baby to accidentally roll over, as opposed to intentionally rolling over. Sometimes, depending on how it happens, rolling over can be more of an instinct than intention. Because of this, it can be hard to see the signs of when your baby is ready to try this on his or her own. Babies will begin to move more and more as they grow. Between new parents and growth, some babies roll over at three weeks! (see YouTube video below). This is likely due to parental guidance or even a mistake; I know of parents who struggled with changing diapers and ended up with kids rolling over as a result.</p>\n<p>Once your baby comes close to the fourth month, you can see if your baby is ready to roll over. <a href=\"/course/guide-to-rolling-over-1/\">One of the ways is to encourage them using a toy or their bottle</a>. When it comes to rolling over, there is usually a reason that they want to do it. Using a toy, parents can often lure babies into following the toy with their arms and eyes enough to create incentive in rolling over. The same thing works with a bottle, if your baby is uses a bottle. Seeing the object they want, they will follow it with their eyes and reach for it with their hands. Once they realize they need to move for it, that is why they will use their muscles to twist enough to the point where they will roll over. Understanding your child’s desires and wants will help you find a good incentive for them.</p>\n<p>Offering an incentive by using a toy can help a child roll over in both directions, from their tummy to their backs, and from their backs to their tummies. Going from the tummy to the back requires different muscles, and because of this, it is likely this will happen this way first. The neck muscles have to be strong enough to hold up the head and turn; the back muscles have to be flexible enough and strong enough to roll with the force of the movement. When the baby is going from the back to the tummy, the neck muscles have to be strong enough to lift the head up off the ground or surface, and then the back muscles have to be strong enough to force the body to twist around. Once more, you can use incentive either way, but it is important to recognize that different muscle groups will need to be exercised accordingly.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/when-do-babies-roll-over-baby-starts-to-roll-over-scaled-e1629212737958.jpg\" alt=\"baby starts to roll over\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h3>Things to Watch</h3>\n<p>While your baby is growing and moving around, it can be tempting to try to push the babies. Many first-time parents will be enthusiastic about getting their children to their milestones, and overlook the importance of quality over speed. I know of several parent groups where it is hard not to try to “one-up” each other with our kids’ accomplishments. With rolling over, there are some concerns that one should watch for, in order to keep your child safe in addition to adventurous.</p>\n<p>One common concern for parents when it comes to rolling over is the idea of the baby rolling over onto his tummy and finding it hard to breathe. If a baby is not strong enough to hold his head up from the mattress or the floor, it is best not to push rolling over. Several parents find the idea of their baby accidentally getting smothered sobering enough to proceed with caution when it comes to rolling over. However, being overly cautious can be just as troublesome for the child. Finding a good balance can be hard and require careful calculation and even bravery, but it is possible and necessary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/baby-sleep-questions-and-answers/\">When it comes to sleeping, if you are concerned about your baby rolling over during while he sleeps</a>, there are several ways to help relief your worry. First, you can make sure your baby is strong enough to push his upper body off the ground with his hands and forearms. If he can do this, there is little chance to worry that he will suffocate during sleep, even if he is a belly sleeper by preference. Second, you can see about getting an inclined pillow to put under his mattress. It is harder for a baby to roll over when she is sleeping on an incline. A slight incline is all you need; there are several options out there for parents. Third, another idea for this is to allow your baby to sleep in a rocker or bouncy seat. I had a rocker for my son and daughter where it could recline and allow them to sleep. I have seen several of my friends with ones that have attachments for playtime and a vibrating massage option; the nice thing about this option is that there is usually more than one benefit in using it. I had a friend who had a baby boy with a very sensitive stomach; at night, he would often burp up because of the gas in his stomach. Because of that, using a car seat and then a rocker helped with his gas and allowed him to sleep much more peacefully.</p>\n<p>Another concern some parents voice is about danger. Babies are unable to see all the way around themselves, so they can sometimes end up rolling over and hitting different objects. To prevent this, you can easily put the child on the floor or a level surface. You can even use a blanket or a clean rug. A rug will likely have a bit more traction, so it will not move around the floor. Using a blanket or a rug can also help you estimate how much space a baby will need. You can also easily keep toys or potentially painful objects off the designated space. This will ensure that as your baby rolls over, or practices <a href=\"/blog/tummy-time\">tummy time</a>, she is safe from anything that will cause her undue surprise or pain.</p>\n<p>In the event that something does happen while your baby rolls over, this is the perfect time for you to snuggle with your baby. My kids would often practice rolling over in my lap. I was there to help them and comfort them at the same time. It is important to keep in mind that accidents do happen from time to time, but they are not reasons to stop.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Roll Over? The Complete Parents Guide.</h2>\n<h3>Resources to Help</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/3-6-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">When it comes to rolling over, there are many things that a parent can do to help</a>. In order to help roll over, there is a physical side of development, and there is a mental preparation side.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86VS3sLKYUs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tummy time is a great way to encourage the physical as well as the mental</a>. When I was a new parent, I marveled at how well my husband would help our kids with tummy time. He would get down on a blanket with them and move their arms around to help them lift up their upper bodies, and then show them how, in slow motion, to do different movements. For rolling over, he always made sure to get them to laugh. This encouraged them to see it as a fun activity, something that they wanted to do, and it would also encourage them to try it on their own, just for fun. This kind of preparation worked well to help my children mentally prepare for the moments when they would roll over of their own volition.</p>\n<p>In addition to tummy time, it can help to massage your children’s muscles. Giving them a back rub can help open up the blood vessels, and that in turn would encourage the body to relax and repair any growing muscles. Along with this is making sure that the babies receive a healthy amount of feeding time. Because rolling over deals with muscle development, getting enough sleep and nutrition plays a larger role than it may seem. With babies, these things are often complementary when it comes to meeting milestones, and that includes rolling over.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Watching a baby roll over, especially for the first time, often inspires a smile. The baby is often surprised, and the parents are pleased and proud, as well as amused. By understanding that rolling over can only happen when your baby has had enough time and care to develop the muscles he or she needs, the incentives to practice and continually challenge him or herself, and the love and support of parental care, rolling over will be one milestone that is easy to overcome. There are several signs to watch for, concerns and cares to plan for, and methods to try during the process of learning. While it takes an average of four months to get ready, and an average of seven months to see your baby roll over both directions, your baby is unique and will grow in his or her own way.

    htmlContent: "<blockquote><p>Babies will usually start teething around six months. Teething can occur early, starting around three months, and it can start as late as ten months. Around six months, parents will be able to see little bumps in the front of the gums; this is the most prominent sign of teething. Other signs of teething include runny noses, fussiness, and trouble sleeping. While parents often do see early signs of teething around this time, it might be many months before the teeth even push through the gums.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>When Do Babies Start Teething, and How Do You Know?</h2>\n<h2>Teething: An Introductory Overview</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/baby-milestones-month-by-month-for-the-first-year/\">Parents love to watch for signs that their children is growing up</a>. Starting from the beginning, they mark off <a href=\"/milestone-tracker\">baby milestones</a> with pride, sweat, and tears. When it comes to teething, parents are especially observant for a number of reasons. Teething, even in its preliminary stages, can affect a child in terms of diet, temperament, attitude, and health.With teeth, children are able to chew more foods, affecting a baby’s diet and feeding routines. A breast-feeding mother might face more challenges when it comes to feeding her baby due to the oncoming arrival of teeth. The pain of teething can also lead to a desire to gum and chew onto different objects in addition to new foods.Teething pains will also affect the child’s temperament. The dulling ache of teething, constant during the day and possibly giving the baby trouble while he or she eats, <a href=\"/blog/5-steps-for-a-better-quitter-night-sleep/\">can cause the child to avoid eating or sleeping</a>. As any parent will be able to tell you, this can lead to other problems. More fussiness, discomfort, and crying can result from this pain. If a baby has siblings, it can also lead to tension between the parties.Finally, teething can also have an impact on a baby’s health. While colds are standard in the growing up experience, teething can lead to more runny noses because of the movement of the teeth. It is important to make sure to practice good teeth hygiene while babies are teething; the good news with this is that practicing healthy teeth habits now will get the baby used to them. In the future, it will encourage the child to undertake his or her own teeth care.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Start Teething, and How Do You Know?</h2>\n<h2>Signs of Teething</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoTTQUXlGnI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When do baby get teeth? When do babies start teething, and how do you know?</a> The results can vary according to the child, but it all starts with the signs.Teething is a process, one that happens over the course of several months. The first signs of teething are the most prominent; there are hardened edges in the baby’s gums, right at the front, usually on the bottom gums, although the top front incisors can also be among the first to show. While teeth usually start to show around the six month mark, teeth can appear earlier, to the point where some babies are born with teeth, as well as later. Some children do not have teeth until closer to their first birthdays.It is important to keep in mind that every child, even if this is your second or third or sixth, is different, and they will experience teething differently. But standards and milestones are still helpful, as is knowing your own family characteristics. In having my own kids, I have noticed that some of our families’ heritages seemed to have influenced this: I did not get teeth until closer to my first birthday, and my husband did not get his until around nine months. If you are concerned about your child’s teething progress, or lack thereof, check with your own family history. Knowing how your families have experienced progress with baby milestones can give you an idea of what to expect, as well as a standard for what is unexpected or troubling, for your baby.While little bumps under the gums are among the first signs of teething, the teeth themselves will not come above the gums for some time. The gums can look swollen as the teeth come in. That’s why some of the other first signs of teething include drooling, irritability, runny noses, and sometimes light fevers and diarrhea. It can seem like the child gets sick more often, but this is largely due to the likeliness of getting more germs in the nasal cavity. In cases like this, it is best to wait for a day or two to see if the symptoms subside on their own.Other signs include feeding disruptions. I know a lot of my mommy friends have had issues with <a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">breastfeed</a>ing while the child is teething. Some children will not experience any difference in their feeding habits one their teeth begin to come in, but others will. Moms who struggle with breastfeeding during this time might want to try a nipple shield and invest in some quality nipple cream. Having a child bite you while you are feeding can disrupt a mother’s concentration and make it hard for her to continue.After my son was born, and I was a new mother, I struggled with breastfeeding. When his teeth started to come in, I began to switch to formula more because it was uncomfortable. I had better luck with my daughter, and I made the choice to use the nipple shield when she began to teeth. It made it much better and I was able to breastfeed longer.<a href=\"/blog/25-reasons-why-your-baby-will-not-stop-crying-and-what-should-you-do-differently/\">It is possible that a baby will not want to feed as much because of the pain in her mouth</a>. She might rub her face or her chin because of teething pain while she does eat, to help combat the pain. This is where it might be best to try a little medicine, about an hour before feedings. That way, the medicine will kick in before she eats, and the pain will lessen enough where she can get a good amount of milk.When teeth do begin to pop up from below the surface of your baby’s gums, it is a good idea to start brushing teeth. For infants, babies under a year old, there are small, finger-sized toothbrushes a parent can wear over his or her finger. Massaging the gums back and forth, these finger brushes can help clean the gums while helping some of the pain of teething to go away. In addition to this, it helps you set a time where your child can get used to brushing his teeth. This is a habit that science has shown has many benefits, and it will affect the health of your child later on as he grows up, too. This prepares a good habit for him to grow into.</p>\n<h2>Resources to Help Teething Babies</h2>\n<p>When your baby exhibits the telltale signs of teething, there are several resources that can help you as a parent, both in understanding teething and handling with the results of teething. Many resources are available through a doctor or medical establishment, while others are available at the store or online.</p>\n<p>Often, a <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/\" title=\"AAP HealthyChildren.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pediatrician</a> will be able to provide you with a teething chart, one that will give insight on the process of teething. A doctor can also make recommendations for medications or offer information on how to comfort your child. I had to use some medication when it was especially bad at night, in order to help my son get to sleep.</p>\n<p>Other moms will swear by the homeopathic route. When my kids were teething, one of the best things I bought was at the store on my own, the homeopathic teething tablets. I have had friends suggest essential oils and others recommend different types of chewing sticks. One family member suggested that I buy amber necklaces for kids. The amber releases a radiation into the child’s skin and allows the teething pain to dull as a result.</p>\n<p>Medicinal and homeopathic traditions do offer a wide range of options in caring for your child when he or she is teething. In addition to this, there are plenty of options when it comes to practical approaches. Several parents will get teething rings, both of a rubbery material and the kind that you can put in the freezer, so when it is cool enough you can give it to your baby to chew on. There are even mommy necklaces now that you can wear while holding or feeding your child that will give them something to chew and hold.</p>\n<p>When it comes to cleaning the baby’s teeth, finger brushes are great. You might have an instance where the baby can bit your finger, but getting the safe baby toothpaste and the baby toothbrush will prepare your baby for taking care of himself or herself later on. I know as my son grew older, we were able to get kid toothbrushes. We are still using the training toothpaste, as my daughter is starting to brush her teeth regularly as well. For this one, I have often thought of the old adage: “Begin as you mean to go on.” It helps center me and direct my focus when I am training my kids on how to be responsible for themselves.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, <a href=\"/blog/parenting-tips/\">the best things you can do as a parent is to try to come at it with a positive attitude</a>. Teething can be rough, but it will not last forever. Babies are very sensitive to their surroundings, and that includes when someone is feeling stressed. Mothers, especially those who struggle with post-partum or breastfeeding, can experience a lot of stress. The best thing to do is relax as much as you can, and acknowledge the loving sacrifices you have made as a parent so far. I know of several parents who have had major life adjustments when their babies came along. It is not as easy a change as it seems in books or films.</p>\n<h2>When Do Babies Start Teething, and How Do You Know?</h2>\n<h2>Exceptions to Standard Teething Expectations</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of expectations which do occur with babies and teething from time to time. There is the occasion where babies are born with teeth, and there are some babies who do not teeth until they are over one year of age. In both these cases, asking your doctor or pediatrician will aid you in handling the situation when it does come.</p>\n<p>When babies have teeth early, it will more likely upset the feeding process.</p>\n<p>Moms with tender nipples may experience more discomfort and struggle to be able to work with a child who is prone to biting. For this, it is often recommended that the mother use a pump in order to help build up her own milk reserves and have a supple on hand if she needs to use a bottle rather than breastfeed. In the event that the mother’s nipples become too sore or cracked, formula is also able to be implemented here.</p>\n<p>Babies who teeth late, while it is not considered ideal, do have a distinct advantage over those who experience early teething. It has been seen that the longer it takes for the teeth to come in, the higher the chance that the child will have healthy teeth. In an age where sugar is often in a large variety of foods, even baby foods, babies with early teething need to make sure they are getting their teeth brushed and cleaned with safe toothbrushes and toothpaste.</p>\n<h2>Babies Start Teething</h2>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>All babies will get their teeth to come in. It is coming, so the best parents know that being prepared and reacting appropriately is key. If your baby does not have all his teeth by the time he is six months old, it is okay to check in with your doctor. If your baby’s teeth come earlier, maybe around three months instead of six, be on the lookout for the signs and side effects that it can have, and adjust as needed. Being a parent means being prepared, so it is not just a matter of principle, it is a matter of love.</p>\n<p><em><strong>When Did your baby started teething? and how did you deal and helped your baby?

    htmlContent: "<h2>The Messy Truth: Why Baby Eating Habits Are Crucial for Development</h2>\n<p>    ! </p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Embracing messy eating is crucial for your baby’s development</strong>. When you allow your baby to get messy during meals, you’re actually supporting their growth in multiple areas. This includes the development of gross and fine motor skills as they learn to manipulate food and utensils, sensory exploration as they experience different textures and tastes, and cognitive development as they learn about cause and effect. By resisting the urge to keep everything clean, you’re providing a rich learning environment for your child.</li>\n<li><strong>Messy eating helps create positive associations with food and mealtimes</strong>. By allowing your baby to explore food freely, you’re fostering independence and a healthy relationship with eating. This approach can prevent mealtime battles and picky eating habits in the future. It’s important to repeatedly expose your baby to various foods, even if they don’t seem to like them at first, as it can take multiple exposures for a baby to develop a taste for new foods. This patience and persistence can lead to a more varied and nutritious diet as your child grows.</li>\n<li><strong>Preparing for and managing the mess can make the experience more enjoyable for everyone</strong>. Instead of stressing about the cleanup, plan ahead by using easy-to-clean surfaces, removing clothing that might get stained, and having cleaning supplies ready. Remember that this messy phase is temporary but the skills your baby is developing are long-lasting. By maintaining a positive attitude towards the mess, you’re creating a relaxed and enjoyable mealtime environment that benefits your baby’s overall development and your family’s dynamics.<strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Baby Eating Frequently asked questions</h2>\n<p><span>Quick Links:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#tve-jump-1905f1050c9\" jump-animation=\"smooth\">Why You Should Let Your Baby Get Messy While Eating</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tve-jump-1905f109d11\">Chewing Skills</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tve-jump-1905f10eeec\">Gross Motor Skills</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tve-jump-1905f112bf0\">Fine Motor Skills</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tve-jump-1905f1176b0\">Sensory Development</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tve-jump-1905f11db6b\">Use of Cutlery and Dishes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tve-jump-1905f1234ca\">Table Manners and Socializing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tve-jump-1905f128238\">Creating Positive Association with Food</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tve-jump-1905f12dd7f\">Clean Up Struggles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tve-jump-1905f134751\">Conclusion</a><a href=\"#tve-jump-18654e92d16\"></a><a href=\"#tve-jump-18654e96c46\"></a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Why You Should Let Your Baby Get Messy While Eating</h2>\n<p>Your baby has reached an important milestone and is ready to begin their first forays into the world of food and it’s going to get messy! While many parents wish that feeding their baby was not quite the messy ordeal, that mess also serves a purpose. While this may mean a little more cleanup is involved for parents, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ6FSr4ECIA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letting your baby make a mess is part of the learning experience and is a natural part of your baby development</a>.We see the funny videos all the time; an adorable <a href=\"/blog/baby-sitting\">baby sit</a>ting in its highchair plastered in strained carrots. Their hair is slick, there are carrots up their nostrils, and the only thing that managed to escape a smearing was their eyeballs…well, sometimes. The highchair is stained orange, the floor has chunks of peas on it, and even the family dog managed to get caught up in the mess. The battle with food has begun.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Chewing Skills</h2>\n<p>Babies are born with the natural reflex action which enables them to suck on breast or bottle. The same can’t be said for chewing. Babies have to learn how to chew and handle food in their mouths. Your baby is ready for solids when tongue thrusting has stopped. <a href=\"/blog/dream-feeding/\">This action is part of the natural sucking reflex which helps babies to get their milk</a> but it has the habit of pushing food back out of baby’s mouth. When this reflex has stopped, your baby is ready to try their first foods.At first, manipulating food around baby’s mouth is pretty difficult for them as they are used to liquids only. You may put in a baby spoon’s worth of cereal in their mouth only to end up needing a shower and a housecleaning. This is perfectly normal and your baby will learn how to control their lips and tongue better as you go. You may not wish to laugh too visibly when your baby “eats” raspberries with their mouth as they can learn rather quickly that you think a rice cereal shower is a great time.If your baby makes weird faces when you introduce a new food, this doesn’t mean they don’t like it. It’s simply a new taste that isn’t what they are used to. Until your baby learns to hold food in their mouth using their lips, you will often see your baby put their fists in their mouth as they try to eat. This allows them to hold the food in and you’re your baby can suck on their fingers and hands to help them to swallow their food. Once your baby has begun to get the hang of eating pureed foods and runny cereals, chunkier foods and finger foods are next to be introduced. Now the fun begins.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/baby-get-messy-eating-baby-eating-with-spoon-scaled-e1629195275606.jpg\" alt=\"baby eating with spoon\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Why You Should Let Your Baby Get Messy While Eating</h2>\n<h2>Gross Motor Skills</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/newborn-tips-and-facts/\">While your baby is learning to enjoy the taste of new things</a>, they are also learning to use their gross motor skills. Gross motor skills are the larger body movements your baby makes, usually those involving movement of their head, arms, legs, and can include milestones like sitting, crawling, or walking. A few well-cooked peas on your baby’s highchair tray can also help them to work their gross motor skills. In order to fine tune their fine motor skills later, your baby must first figure out how to get their arm and hand to where the food is. While this skill level is usually quite quickly learned, it is still quite the achievement and can be a little messy. Instead of peas in hand, your baby will often end up being the living and breathing equivalent of a jackhammer. Be prepared to watch the peas fly, get plastered all over the highchair tray, and watch how your baby chew on his hands in his efforts to get at those peas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Fine Motor Skills</h2>\n<p><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>Fine motor skills are those thumb and finger movements you make in order to pick up a small object, among other things. Your baby will begin to work on these skills by trying to use their hands as a rake across their feeding surface. You may end up with more food on the floor or on their lap than in their little mouths, but learning is hard work.As <a href=\"/course/intro-to-9-12-months-baby-development-series/\">babies begin to eat with their hands and work on their fine motor skills</a> they will begin to try to grasp small pieces of food between their fingers and bring it to their mouths. The food may fly as they throw pieces onto the floor and although this may just seem like a mess, it is really complex learning. Your baby is learning about their environment and how to control their bodies just as much as they are learning how to eat. Projectiles of cereal loops teach your baby about gravity, how their physical action result in a physical result, and is a good opportunity to teach them table manners and skills.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Sensory Development</h2>\n<p><strong></strong><strong></strong>Even though that mess may seem rather useless at first glance, it is like information uploading to the brain. Baby’s senses are in continuous development as they progress through various milestones and development of the senses is extremely important. Feeling food as it squishes through their fingers teaches them about the different textures all around them, how things smell, and how they taste.Baby playing with their food teaches them how their food sounds when it gets squished or thrown on the floor, how it looks differently than it did originally, and how the texture has changed in their hands and their mouths. All of this is very useful learning that will be applied throughout your baby’s lifetime and can teach them how they have a direct effect on their environment and what specific actions end up with as results.Unless your baby is trying to wipe away food from their face, leave it be until they are finished eating unless it is close to their eyes or could impede their breathing. Getting mashed potatoes on your cheek feels like something. How you held your spoon and missed your mouth and got mushy potatoes all over your chin provides sensory cues and helps your baby learn how to adapt their movements to avoid this happening again. Besides, it doesn’t necessarily feel bad to be messy and it is something we often look back on to our childhood with fondness. As adults we often wish we could just dive into our food with joy and abandon for a reason…because it was great when we did it as kids.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Use of Cutlery and Dishes</h2>\n<p><strong></strong>As your baby masters picking up food and putting it into their mouth, you may get a temporary reprieve from some of the messiness. It’s not over yet. Next comes learning to eat food off of bowls and plates with forks and spoons. Your baby is ready to learn as soon as they show interest in getting their hands on the spoon, and while it may be a while before they are able to do much with it, holding it in their hands and manipulating it is an important part of learning to use it.While you may be tempted to use the same dishes and cutlery the family uses, babies learn best off of tools designed for them specifically. Many baby dishes have deeper sides so your baby can better chase food around and scoop it up, and many divided dishes come with suction cups on the bottom so your baby doesn’t spend most of its time learning about how gravity affects a bowl. Forks and spoons are made smaller for tiny baby fingers and mouths and we all know that using the right tool for the job makes the job a lot easier.</p>\n<p>Try mashed foods first. These may prove easier to scoop up with a piece of cutlery. At first, your baby may just play around with the cutlery and continue to dive in with their hands, sucking food off of their fingers, spreading it around, or removing it from the plate or bowl. Position the fork or spoon properly in your baby’s hand and help them get some food on it and guide it to their mouth. <a href=\"/courses/12-24-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">This uses both gross and fine motor skills and will be a challenge for them at first</a>. Be prepared for projectiles as food flies off of the cutlery as your baby attempts to use this tool…and spoons make great missile launchers.Over time, your baby will become a pro at using these adult tools but will often return to eating with their hands, dropping food over the edge, or throwing their spoon. These activities are a normal part of your <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">baby development</a> and will diminish as your child gets older and they learn their table manners and social norms. Finger foods are always fun as adults and even we find they taste better without the forks and spoons, so it is only natural that your baby wants to get their hands in there, chew and suck on their fingers, and lick off all that great grub. Constantly wiping away any trace of food can increase the likelihood that your baby will become overly sensitive to different textures touching them and can create sensory difficulties that make your child uncomfortable to stimuli.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Why You Should Let Your Baby Get Messy While Eating</h2>\n<h2>Table Manners and Socializing</h2>\n<p><strong></strong>While a simple, “We don’t throw food on the floor,” doesn’t seem to have much effect, over time it and other eating lessons come together to teach our baby table manners, social skills during eating and what is acceptable behavior. In the meantime, plan to repeat yourself a lot and pick up food from the floor after each meal. Provide food of many different colors and don’t worry if your baby doesn’t seem to like it much at first tasting. Baby’s taste buds are more sensitive than those of adults and it can take 5-10 exposures with a particular food before your baby will begin to like it. Offer the same items multiple times, sneak a bite of their “disliked” food in with other items, and over time they will begin to like this new food.Meal time is time to socialize, talk about your day, and spend time as a family. Habits learned at this age can last a lifetime so it is important to teach as you intend to continue. If your family doesn’t think eating in front of the television is appropriate, feed your baby at the table from the onset. If your baby is not due to eat or not hungry and it is everyone else’s mealtime, put them in their highchair and put a few tidbits on their tray. Babies learn from everything around them and will mock what you do as they learn it. They are ever watchful and will take note of what you are doing and learn through exposure. Even if they are not hungry, providing them with a fork or spoon and a little food will turn into a tactile sensory learning time and can help to get them on the same schedule as you’re on.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Creating Positive Association with Food</h2>\n<p><strong></strong>Fighting to get food in your baby’s mouth, to regain the spoon, or to continuously keep them clean creates a negative association with food and mealtime. Food is supposed to be healthy, fuel for your body, and enjoyable. It doesn’t take long for a baby to learn to associate things and you don’t really want to make it so that every time your baby sees a spoon they clamp their mouth shut, turn their head away, or resort to a crying jag. Keep mealtime positive by allowing your baby to be somewhat independent. That means letting them have some control over their own feeding. Give them their own spoon while you feed them with another.Pause to let them try new things on their own before making it a battle of wills. As individuals, all people want to exert some independence. That doesn’t mean your baby should only eat peas because that’s all they like. Foods should be repeatedly reintroduced to allow exposure to develop into a taste for the item. While it is not always appropriate to let your baby do whatever they want, if you provide the healthy options and they can choose from them themselves, this allows a level of independence that is acceptable for both you and your child. Your baby has their own personality and it will continue to develop throughout their entire life and making something a negative experience is bound to result in a battle of wills at every meal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Clean Up Struggles</h2>\n<p><strong></strong><strong></strong>Mess is just mess. In most circumstances, mess is rather easy to clean up even if it takes a few moments. If you prepare in advance, most messes are easy to fix and do nothing but take a few moments of your time to clean up. While bibs may be effective in some circumstances, parents will often find there is no bib big enough to make up for a baby learning to feed themselves. Instead of worrying about your child staining and ruining their clothing…take them off before you put them in their highchair.Place the baby’s highchair in an area that has a flooring material that is easily cleaned. If you have carpet everywhere, simply purchase a cheap plastic tablecloth or mat and sit your baby’s highchair on it for easier cleanup. Most highchairs have tray you can throw right in the dishwasher for easy cleaning. If you wash dishes by hand, the sooner you wipe up the tray the less difficult it will be to get smushed food off. If you’re more relaxed and let things sit for a while after a meal before you clean up, simply soak the tray in warm, soapy water for a few moments and most things will come right off. Use only child-friendly, non-toxic cleansers on your child’s highchair. Because their food is often directly on the surface, you don’t want it absorbing any chemical residues that have been left behind.If your baby doesn’t like to get cleaned up at the end of a meal it may be best just to give them a bath as most babies and toddlers love to play in the water. If this can’t be done, remove your child from the highchair and bring them to the sink area. This will help prevent your baby from associating sitting in the highchair with the unpleasant task of getting washed up. For example, if every time your child eats spaghetti they have to have their face, hands, arms, and body scrubbed before they can leave the highchair, this can lead them to associate spaghetti with something they don’t like. They may then learn to hate spaghetti. Let your baby get messy! They’ll learn many things about the environment they live in and learn that meals are a positive time of day that should be enjoyed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p><strong></strong>Let your baby get messy while he or she is eating. Your baby will reach important milestones through eating and getting messy, and the mess your baby makes also serves a purpose. While this means that more cleanups is involved, letting your baby make a mess is part of the learning experience and is a natural part of your baby development.<em><strong>Where did you find foods around your kitchen or dining area?

When babies are born prematurely, there is always an extra helping of worry for the parents to face.</p>\n<p>The good news is much of that anxiety can be helped through learning. <a href=\"/blog/premature-baby-care/\">Most of the distress parents of premature babies face is because of a lack of ready knowledge</a>. To help ebb the tidal wave of fear and uncertainty, here are some things to keep in mind with premature babies and their development.</p>\n<h2>Attitude is Most Important</h2>\n<p>Premature babies are born all the time. There is a wealth of information out there on how to help them make it through their birth and all the way through their premature <a href=\"/milestone-tracker\">baby milestones</a>. It is not your fault the baby was born early. This is not a punishment. You might have been surprised by your baby’s early arrival, but you can still control how you react to it. You need to make sure you are relaxed (hard to do right after a birth, I know), and you are focused on the task ahead of you. You must be resolved as any parent is; with premature babies, this is not different, but I am bringing it up here because there is a learning curve with a premature baby you likely did not have when your baby was supposed to be an ‘on-time baby.’</p>\n<h2>Premature Baby Facts</h2>\n<p>I had a friend who had a premature baby by seven weeks. It was a really scary and stressful time for her, and all the more so because she had her son, who was two years old, at the time. She told me later on, it was a relief to her that even though her daughter had been born premature, the nurses and doctors both assured her <a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">it was possible for her daughter to hit all her milestones and develop normally</a>. Just because a baby is premature, there is no reason that this alone should cause delays. Still, there were some things her health care professionals recommended in order to help her ‘bridge the gap’ between the full term baby and the premature baby standards.</p>\n<h2>Feeding after Birth</h2>\n<p>One of the most surprising premature babies facts is in regards to <a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">breastfeed</a>ing, or feeding in general if you are not breastfeeding. When babies come on time, most of the new moms settle into breastfeeding soon after birth. <a href=\"/blog/newborn-tips-and-facts/\">With premature babies, it is better to wait longer to begin feeding them</a>. When I first heard this, I was surprised and thought it was counter-intuitive. However, as I listened to the explanation for it, it became more logical. Premature babies have delicate gastrointestinal systems. They may not be completely ready to begin processing breastmilk or formula, and if they become distressed, their intestines can experience a wide range of difficulties. Often, nurses will keep the babies hydrated through IVs until the new mom can feed her child.</p>\n<p>When my kids were born, even though they were both late, they didn’t need to eat so much, because their bodies were still full of the nutrients they had from the umbilical cord, too. So while it may seem odd to wait to feed the premature babies, it is in their best interest to make sure their bellies can handle digestion.</p>\n<h2>Keeping Baby Warm</h2>\n<p>Premature babies struggle to keep warm, even more than full term babies. Hats are especially helpful here, so the heat can stay inside the baby. If it is possible, it can be a really nice thing to hold your baby to your skin and gently massage his or her body. Massaging the body can stimuli the sensory nerves and develop muscles more quickly. This is something that is true with all babies, but premature babies especially, since they are so small.</p>\n<p>In addition to keeping the babies close, there are several different ways to keep them warm and stimulated. Some people will gently pat out rhythms on their babies’ bodies, to keep them warm and to help encourage deeper sleep (like a pat-a-cake lullaby) and others will go the “baby torilla wrap” way, wrapping up the babies in a taco-like manner to keep the body heat inside.</p>\n<p>The favorite premature baby care <a href=\"/blog/baby-cradling-important/\">way of new parents to keep their babies warm is to just cradle them</a>. When my son was born, I don’t think I put him down until I had to. He spent the first twenty-four hours of his life next to me, and I eventually realized letting my husband take care of his diapers was an advantage, even if I had to let my son go. When my daughter was born, we were at a different hospital, but I still didn’t want her out of my arms for very long. Since my kids are close in age, I remember holding her and trying very hard not to fall asleep with her in my arms.</p>\n<h2>Premature Baby Care: How You Can Help with Premature Babies and their Development</h2>\n<h2>Tracking Progress</h2>\n<p>One of the more critical learning curve points with a premature baby is the need to keep track of the baby’s progress. There are all sorts of milestones for babies, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM1C6sPfO8w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">premature babies development is to be closely monitored</a>. Some of the things especially monitored are growth, weight, milestones, and habits. Seeing your premature baby’s doctor 24-48 hours after leaving the hospital can help familiarize yourself with the premature infant growth chart, the premature milestones, and the week by week development. The <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/\" title=\"AAP HealthyChildren.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pediatrician</a> is largely recognized as the main authority on how well your baby is developing.</p>\n<p>I highly encourage you as a parent to find a pediatrician you like. These are the doctors that, ideally, will see your kids for years to come. My husband and I had a rocky relationship with my son’s pediatrician at first – between the long waits in the waiting room, the busybody administrative assistant, the long waits in the exam room, and the five-minute appointment with the actual doctor, we didn’t feel like my son’s pediatrician was paying quite the right amount of attention to him. When my daughter was born, we switched to a different doctor, and we have a much better time with appointments now. This is critical for premature babies, because doctors will want to monitor their progress even more than a baby who was born on time or even late, like mine. My friend who had a premature baby by six weeks told me once she had to take her daughter in every week and call the doctor if anything concerned her about diet, breathing, movement, or diapers. If you are going to be interacting frequently with someone over a very personal topic like children, if you and the pediatrician are going over premature babies and their development week by week, it is best you can agree on priorities and keep it as pleasant as possible.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/premature-baby-care-babies-development-Premature-Baby-Care-And-the-Parent-scaled-e1629194729299.jpg\" alt=\"Premature Baby Care And the Parent\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Premature Baby Care Milestones</h2>\n<p>When babies are born, <a href=\"/blog/baby-milestones-month-by-month-for-the-first-year/\">there are certain milestones to be expected of them around certain ages</a>. Crawling, standing, walking, talking, and playing ball are some of the most well-known milestones, but there are several other activities as well. When a premature baby is born, typically the infant chart is adapted to account for their early weeks. A premature baby’s time is changed based on how early he or she came out of the womb, and can be further adapted based on any physical concerns. For example, a healthy premature baby born five weeks early might have a month or two delay when it comes to walking. So if walking for a normal baby occurs around 10 months, a premature baby might need until twelve months to begin walking. This is another topic where you will have to talk over the adjustments with your baby’s doctor, and you will revisit it frequently based on your child’s progress.</p>\n<h2>Premature Baby Long-Term Effects</h2>\n<p>Once the baby has been out of the hospital, and you have been enjoying her at home for a while, you might start to forget that your baby was a premature arrival. This is usually how people feel after the short-term concerns of premature births become standard for their day-to-day life. The fears for the long-term effects usually get triggered when the baby starts to hit her milestones, or is expected to start hitting her milestones and she doesn’t.</p>\n<p>While many premature babies don’t suffer any long-term effects of being born early, there are some higher areas of concerns. The lungs, for example, are among the last organs to develop while they are in gestation, so when a premature baby arrives, one of the most closely monitored activities of a baby is how well his or her breathing is going. Asthma is linked to early birth, but it is not unheard of that a baby will grow out of it as his lungs develop and he is more active. Premature babies development later in life have been seen to life full and active lives no differently from their full-term baby counterparts.</p>\n<p>There are occasions, however, where there are some longer-term issues with the child. If your child displays behavior that concerns you, there are plenty of things you can do to help with their progress. One of the best examples I have seen is getting a developmental therapist for your child. These are the people who can help your baby get ready to crawl, walk, and move around. While as a parent you often teach your babies how to do many things as they grow, such as holding a spoon, the therapist is trained specifically to key in on the baby’s needs efficiently, and work to correct it. For my friend, she says getting a physical therapist for her daughter really helped her baby progress; after a few months with the therapist, her daughter was on track with full-term babies.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with the physical and occupational therapist options, there are also speech therapists who can help your baby. This can help when the child is as young as two, and if there <a href=\"/course/developing-communication-gibberish-and-laughter/\">has been slower speech development than normal, a speech therapist can come in and help</a> work with the child to physically form the words with her mouth as well as speak them.</p>\n<p>In the case of physical deformities, it is important to remember that examinations with the pediatrician and, if needed, specialists, are required. I knew a child who was born early, and her one earlobe did not develop fully. Even now, she has a much smaller ear on one side than the other. However, while her ear is small, it is still functional. Her mother takes her in to get it checked by a doctor and a specialist every year to make sure as she grows, she will not run into any issues with her hearing.</p>\n<p>While outside physical deformities are a concern, perhaps more caution needs to be attended to physical deformities on the inside of a baby’s body. I had a friend with a son who had a small hole in his heart when he was born at thirty-three weeks. He had to go and see a cardiologist and get his heart examined with an ultrasound every couple of weeks to make sure the hole wasn’t getting any bigger or causing him issues.</p>\n<h2>Premature Babies and You</h2>\n<p>The truth of the matter is, no matter if you have a full-term baby or a preemie, as a parent you will always want to do what’s best for your child. You will make the sacrifices for them, because they are yours and you love them. Once you’ve committed yourself to them, learned all you need to, carefully monitor progress, and work towards a better tomorrow, you will find the real difference is in meeting the specialized needs of your baby.</p>\n<h2>Premature Baby Care Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Keep it simple, because stress and likely sleep deprivation will affect how you interact with your preemie. Remember to keep your emotions in check, keep as much of a level head as possible, and do the simple things first: check your babies for warmth, make sure they don’t eat before they are ready, and when they do, make sure they don’t overeat; keep up with your doctor’s visits, and always have a plan and a back-up plan ready if something concerns you. It is this loving proactive decision which will help you see it through.</p>\n<p><em><strong>We will be happy to hear from your experience with premature babies, how did you cope and how did it effect you?</strong></em></p><p style=\"margin-top:1.5em\"><strong>Ready to support your baby’s development?</strong> <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">Explore the BabyPillars program</a>, milestone-based guidance for every stage.</p>",

Other babies skip the crawling stage altogether and immediately stand up and start to walk on two feet. The way your baby starts mobilization is insignificant, the main thing is that he has the ability to move and he is mobile in space which enables independent exploration of his environment.</span></p>\n<h2><span>How does crawling starts?</span></h2>\n<p><span>Most babies will start to crawl on six after they learn to sit steadily, without support, usually around the age of 7 months. At this stage your baby’s back muscles are strong enough to bear his weight when he gets on his knees and hands.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the coming months your baby will learn to safely move from sitting to crawling on all six.

    htmlContent: "<blockquote><p><a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">Breastfeed</a> is a very intimate phenomenon that occurs between a mother and a new born. Breastfeed does not only provides the new born with the energy but also strengthens the bond between a mother and her offspring.There are times when the mother is not physically present to breastfeed the new born and hence alternative methods have to be explored to get rid of this obstacle and to make sure that the new born gets his nutrition regardless of the absence or presence of mother. But in doing so, you have to face a lot of kinds of problem and there are ways to overcome them systemically.</p></blockquote>\n<h1>Top 9 bottles to breastfeed your newborn baby</h1>\n<p>The first problem that many mothers face is the <a href=\"/blog/newborn-tips-and-facts/\">rejection of the bottle feeding by the new born</a>. This can be as a result of a lot of factors which might either be involved individually or collectively. It is the natural instinct of a new born child to suckle on the nipples of his mother in order to acquire milk. It is also seen in some cases that the while breastfeed a newborn tends to grab the breast by his hand or simply touch it in order to start the act of suckling.</p>\n<p>Mother’s mammary glands are regulated in such a way that the milk produced in them is strictly controlled and produced on the basis of demand. Within the first week, the mother and the newborn get along a specific schedule according to which they adjust the nutrition cycle and so does the mammary glands as they produce milk when it is about time for the baby to suck on. Even if the milk is produced it remains stored in the breast and does not come out on its own. It is only when the baby touches the breast or starts suckling on the nipple that the milk is allowed to let go of from the breast. This whole phenomenon of releasing milk is called letting down.</p>\n<p>Now, the <a href=\"/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-secretes/\">infants who are used to breastfeeding normally</a> deny getting fed from an artificial cup or a container and even a feeder bottle. This can at times become quite a task to get the new born to shift from breastfeeding to bottle feeding with the breast milk in it. Some of the factors to take care of in such an event are following. Try to change the type of nipple on the bottle. Different babies prefer different stuff of nipple and hence there is no hard and fast rule for that. Then the <a href=\"/blog/how-to-work-with-0-3-month-old-babies-on-their-milestones/\">next thing to consider is the position of the baby</a>. At times the baby prefers the person feeding him to look at him or even hold him close to his skin so that they get a feeling of comfort. In some rare cases the newborn rejects to take milk from the feeder bottle because the milk is cold or hotter than the temperature of the breast milk and hence you might have to look out for the temperature as well.</p>\n<p>This having been said now let me introduce you some of the top in line bottle feeders and some salient features of all of them so that you get to have a basic idea of what they are and which one will best suit your need. Following is the list of top of the line nine bottle breast milk feeder bottles.</p>\n<h3>Baby Bottles by Comotomo</h3>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, some babies prefer the sensation of touch while breastfeeding. These babies while breastfeed need to touch the breast in order to be comfortable and even start suckling in the first place. Keeping this necessity of babies in the mind, comotomo has developed a bottle which is made up of a polymer which gives it a flexible body as well as the surface texture which is as soft as the skin of breast and hence it will easily be able to mimic a human breast as the child will grab onto it and start sucking on the bottle considering it a breast. Being a baby product, the plastic used in the making of comotomo baby bottles is reasonably made from safe plastic in order to prevent them from any harmful diseases as well as to make them environment friendly.</p>\n<h3>Natural Bottle by Philips AVENT</h3>\n<p>Philips AVENT is the pioneer of the bottle feeding community and hence is not only well known but one of the most trusted brands in child nursing domain. In order to further facilitate its customers in the breast milk feeding as well Philips AVENT has introduced its newest in the line natural bottle. As evident by its name, natural bottle tries to mimic a human breast in all the ways.</p>\n<p>The basic design of the bottle is made and shaped in such a way that the baby should assume it as a human breast to grab on and start sucking the milk from the bottle. Moreover the nipple provided with the bottle is made up of a very safe and smooth to touch plastic which mimics the nipple of a human breast.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/top-9-bottles-breastfeed-newborn-baby-breastfeed-and-baby-feeding-scaled-e1629188710668.jpg\" alt=\"breastfeed and baby feeding\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h3>Original Nurser by Playtex Drop-Ins</h3>\n<p>One of the most trusted brand of feeding bottles that one can come across. For more than a decade, moms all over the globe have not only trusted it but also actually preferred them over all other feeding bottles. Original nurser has the minimal design and most simple of all the bottles that are available for the breast milk feeding purpose.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it has a simpler nipple made up of latex and a simple round edged bottle to which newborns seem to get familiar with as soon as they get in touch with. Or may be the reason of its popularity is its ever affordable price which is almost half than any other bottle. Like avent bottles, they also have the bottle liners which actually help in keeping the air from going into the tract of the baby. So, in short, original nurser by Playtex drop-ins has all the qualities of a fancy bottle but it is affordable at the same time.</p>\n<h3>Breastfeed Set by Medela Calma</h3>\n<p>Coming from the Medela Calma, one has the surety of this breast feeding set knowing its business as medela calma itself is the largest supplier of breast pumps and other necessary breastfeeding related appliances and equipment. This time they have developed a bottle which will help people feed their young ones with the breast milk.</p>\n<p>This bottle is slightly longer and bulkier than the rest of the bottle feeders. But the interesting part about this is its nipple which actually has to be assembled before putting into function. This nipple not only prevents the back flow  of air into the canal of baby but also lets the milk go down the nipple when it is sucked upon by the <a href=\"/0-3-months-baby\">newborn baby</a>.</p>\n<h3>Closer to Nature Bottles by Tommee Tippee</h3>\n<p>Tommee tippee has done a marvelous job in making a transitional feeding bottle. This bottle has particularly acquired a shape just like human breast which has two advantages, first one being that it is now easy for anyone to hold this bottle and prevent it from damaging the kid.</p>\n<p>Secondly, with such a design a newborn can easily be shifted towards bottle feeding while a baby is breastfeed. Moreover, unlike most of the feeder bottles, tommee tippee is made up from very safe plastics that confirm all the points of safety and hence assure the health and safety of mother and child who are in consideration. These plastics are also quite stretchable which makes the baby to even bite and chew the nipple in order to feel at home. Plus in the bottle there is a valve which prevents the flow of air and <a href=\"/course/newborn-development/\">causes certain troubles in newborn</a>.</p>\n<h3>The bottle by Yoomi</h3>\n<p>In the description above we discussed the incidence of newborn rejecting the bottle milk because of the fluctuation of the temperature. And hence it is necessary for the milk to be at a certain specific temperature in order for the new born to not only accept it but also to drink it happily. Also a certain temperature of the mother’s milk is easily accepted by the digestive system of the baby and hence a lot of future problems can be avoided by making sure the milk is digested properly.</p>\n<p>As soon as the milk is out of the breasts of mother it starts getting cold and in some cases we even store it for later use. In all these cases it is a hassle to reheat the milk as we cannot directly heat it because of the chances of degeneration. For this very purpose, we have the ultimate bottle by yoomi which offers us the luxury of internal heating mechanism which can be immersed in the water. Just before feeding the baby, the mechanism is turned on and it makes sure to warm the milk to a certain degree before the milk touches the mouth of the baby.</p>\n<h3>Breastfeed flow Bottle by The First Years</h3>\n<p>As evident by the name, the breast flow bottle makes sure that the flow of the milk from the bottle is similar to that of the human breast. For this particular reason, it employs the mechanism of sucking as well as pressing the bottle at the same time. Sucking is done by the baby while the pressing is done by the person feeding it. Hence the dose can be controlled which the child takes in. this two stage feeding mechanism perfectly mimics the action of a human breast. Plus the shape and size of the bottle is almost identical to that of a human breast and hence the new born gets rapidly familiar with it and not many obstacles have to be overcome to make the transition happen. This bottle is equally useful whether the milk formula is used or breast milk is used, the efficacy of the bottle remains unaltered.</p>\n<h3>Adiri NxGen Nurser</h3>\n<p>Adiri NxGen nurser is the ultimate feeding bottle in the market now days. With its latest bottom vent system it is putting other bottles to shame and hence getting popular amongst the nursing mothers every passing day. Unlike other bottles, there are no valves or mechanisms in the nipple. Rather there is a vent on the bottom of the feeder bottle which can be adjusted to make sure that the air does not bother the baby while it is breastfeeding.</p>\n<p>The air if ingested by the baby during the feeding causes serious discomfort in the baby later and hence it is a relief to have such a feeder bottle which avoids such situation. It is easy to clean as both top and bottom can be removed and similarly the milk can be topped up into the bottle from both sides making it more useful for the nursing parents to use for their newborns. A cleaner feeder bottle means healthier babies and the specific breast shaped top helps in getting the baby acquainted to the bottle earlier than any other feeder bottle.</p>\n<h3>Mimijumi</h3>\n<p>These bottles are being called the closest to human breasts both in their looks as well as their function. They are small in size and the top nipple is made up of the softest plastic. Moreover the nipple is colored exactly like the nipple color of human beings plus the granular appearance of the nipple makes it look next identical to the real thing and hence more acceptable by the baby. These bottles while a baby is breastfeed, are made up of the safest and the most compliant of all polymers which are not only healthy but also give a very neat look accompanied with a soft texture.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>So, in short, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVZvl5-zyAs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">there are many variants of the feeding bottles available in the market</a>. These bottles offer various features combined and hence being a nursing parent one can choose to either go for one or more of these bottles in order to best cater the needs of their newborn. This will make the transition from breastfeeding to bottle feeding an easy and enjoyable experience.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Which bottle are you using? Do you prefer one on the other?

I once told my mother I could not remember not having them, and so when I would remember something from a long time ago, I would add them into the picture. My children had come, and surrounded themselves in my heart and mind so much I was making new memories with them from old ones.</p>\n<p>As much of a hindrance this might have been for some things – such as remembering old time with friends – it also helped me remind me of their milestones. At the three-month mark, I was able to look for and identify new milestones for my kids; before, I had needed some help from their doctors and my husband and other family members.The other part of the reason this became much easier is because there were different kinds of milestones popping up around the third month. There were social milestones, same as before the three month mark, but there were also gross motor skills, fine motor skills, and language skills to look for now.</p>\n<h2>Social Milestones</h2>\n<p>One of the best milestones every parent looks for is whether their child is smiling or not. We do it so often while we look at our children, especially in those first few months; <a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-smile/\">when they begin to smile back, it is like making a new friend</a>.</p>\n<p>The key with this social milestone to count is to see if your baby will smile in response to social stimulation; many parents will mistake the gassy smiles or the sleepy grins for true smiles. I know they look sweet, but the milestone is technically not met unless the smile is in response to a social situation. For my kids, some of their <a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-smile\">first smile</a>s were when my husband would tickle their feet or if I would sing them to sleep. (That is part of the reason I thought my kids smiled early – they smiled as they slept!)</p>\n<p>Smiling is a milestone that can actually happen before three months as well, but on average, it comes up in the three-month milestone range. To check the ability of your child to smile in response to social stimulation, there are many ways to choose to engage with them. You can talk to your baby, teasing him with a nice touch to the face, or chin; you can examine if your baby is smiling and responding to this stimulation from your voice or touch. As you can see, this is a pretty easy one to do; many parents coo and gush over their babies so much, they can check for this milestone and not even be aware of it.</p>\n<p>As the three-month mark passes into the fourth month, spontaneous smiles become more common; this is where your baby will begin to smile from time to time while he or she is awake, and they are not being socially engaged. Many times, my son and daughter would smile while watching our animals, or if they were playing in the baby swing we had set up for them.</p>\n<p>You can check the ability to smile spontaneously by examining whether your baby smiles spontaneously from time to time (i.e. not initiated in response to a stimulus.) The key difference in this spontaneous smile is just to make sure they are not engaging with you or another person while they are smiling; they are just smiling as part of their ‘resting face.’ In addition to smiling, other social milestones become easy to check on.</p>\n<p>Before three months, babies can often begin to ‘track’ objects as they cross the middle line of their vision. This ability improves throughout the third to sixth months. To see your baby’s ability to make eye contact and the ability to track face movement or an object in motion, put your baby on his back or hold him in front in your lap facing towards you. When your baby moves his eyes up, move your head to the left and right through the center about 20-30 inches away from your baby’s eyes. Repeat the action with any object; for this practice, make sure there are no sounds or voices accompanying the action. <a href=\"/courses/6-9-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">By the end of the sixth month, this should be a regular practice for your baby</a>. I saw this one early on with my kids, thanks to my cats and my dogs; on a side note, if you can do pets with your babies, it is a great way to keep them stimulated and interested! Even after the first months are over, pets can help with the fine and gross motors skill developments.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/milestones-for-your-3-to-6-month-old-baby-milestones-for-3-4-month-baby-e1629187516722.jpg\" alt=\"Milestones for 3-4 month baby\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Milestones for Your 3 to 6 Month Old Baby</h2>\n<h2>Fine Motor Skills at Four Months In</h2>\n<p>As your baby grows, she will eventually get more fidgety as well; this is when you will see more fine motor skills starting to appear. Fine motor skills are smaller muscle movements, which often happen while the baby focuses on the movements. For example, he or she might become fixated on her toes and, as a result, start to move their feet.</p>\n<p>Around the time of the four-month mark, crossing fingers, playing with hands, and making movements with her fingers and feet will become regular occurrences. If you want to see if your baby wants to play with his hands and the ability for fingers integration, lay your baby on her back and on a flat surface.</p>\n<p>Look at her and examine whether she plays with her hands in front of her body, whether she brings them to her mouth, and whether she is able to cross her fingers between her two hands. My daughter still often falls asleep with her hands together, with her fingers laced; my son, however, often began to grab and play with his toes at when he was four months old.</p>\n<p>Grabbing is another key infant milestone that also occurs alongside this one. I experienced a lot of this with both of my kids; they would grab objects around this time, so I had to be more careful about what I placed next to them. I remember my son would often grab a toy and then drop it from his highchair, and then look over at me and cry so I would pick it up. For my daughter, I had to watch out for this one with my hair; she liked to grab my hair quite a bit at this age, and she did not grow out of it very quickly, much to my dismay. On the bright side, she got a lot of practice.</p>\n<p>You can check your baby’s expression of interest in an external object and the ability to control his arms. To do this, set your baby on his back or hold him in your lap, close to your body. Give him an object comfortable for grip this from a short distance and encourage him to reach out and touch or grab the object. Pay attention to do this each hand separately.</p>\n<p>Once more, I recommend doing this with a toy or a blanket – not your hair! I did help transition my kids’ interest in my hair to my pets, however. I would often sit with them on my lap and let them ‘pet’ the kitties or the dog. While I am sure my pets were less than thrilled, they have a better chance of dodging my kids and their grasping hands more than I do. If you have pets, this can help the pets get used to the kids as well. Or at least, train them to stay away from your kids.</p>\n<h2>Gross Motor Skills Get Going</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/how-to-work-with-0-3-month-old-babies-on-their-milestones/\">During the three to six month old milestone range</a>, fine motor skills are not the only things that are begin developed. This is also when gross motor skills begin to show up. Motor skills are general movements the body makes using the brain, nervous system, and muscles. Fine motor skills are smaller muscle groups, and the gross motor skills are the larger ones. As a result, your babies might all move at different times, since coordination of the larger muscles can be tricky when they are infants.</p>\n<p>One of the first milestones for the gross motor skills that comes up is your child’s ability to lift his head and chest supported by the elbows and forearms. This is one of the milestones that can be very different child to child. Typically, it will still come up in the third or fourth month. Your baby’s ability to lift his head and chest, and his ability to lean on his elbows and forearms when lying on his stomach can be developed with <a href=\"/blog/tummy-time\">Tummy Time</a>.</p>\n<p>This is how my kids did it; my husband would put a blanket down on our floor and lay them down on their stomach, and he would help them to hold their head up. He would also arrange their forearms on the ground so they would get used to the position. You can do the same thing; just lay your baby on his stomach and on a level surface. Encourage him to lift his head and chest through stimulation, and while you can show him what do it, let him try it without helping him. Your baby should be able to lift his head and chest with the support of his forearms, with the intention to reach an object or to glance at one.</p>\n<p>To encourage our babies, my husband would put his keys down in front of them; the shining keys was an instant appeal for both of our kids. You can also do this with toys, or I would occasionally get in front of them and try to get them to watch me with their eyes.</p>\n<p>Along with this milestone, many babies develop the ability to hold their heads steady. You can see this if you lift your baby with your hands, without relying on your body. Your baby’s head needs to remain stable; check that it is not slipping back. When my son first came, I would gather him close to me, and hold him upright in my arms, so I could get a good look at him; this is often when he would practice holding his head steady. I did the same thing with my daughter, since being upright really seemed to help them both practice keeping their head and necks stable.</p>\n<p>For this one, you can combine these last two milestones to get your baby to lift his head and chest while relying on the hands with the elbows straight; this is something your baby usually does a bit later on, around the fifth month, up to even the eighth month. Check the elevation of your baby’s head and chest, having all of his body weight relying on his hands when lying on his stomach.</p>\n<p>You can see this as you encourage him to lift his head and chest through stimulation, without helping him by touching his back or bottom. Your baby should be able to lift his head and chest while relying on the hands with the elbows straight and locked with the intention of reaching an object that is close him, to or look at it. For this one, I found practice to be the key. <a href=\"/course/how-to-start-baby-tummy-time/\">Between Tummy Time and holding them upright to cuddle</a>, my kids caught on pretty quickly when it came to keeping their head and neck stable.</p>\n<p>Another favorite milestone of parents tends to be when their child will turn from his tummy to his back, and vice versa. Babies will usually learn this sometime between the third and seventh month, but a lot of it depends on incentive. My son learned to turn over very quickly, because he liked to try to sneak away from me while I changed his diapers; my daughter, much more docile, would just flail her arms and legs while she was getting her diapers changed. To check this milestone, lay your baby on a flat and secure surface.</p>\n<p>Attract his attention with a toy or rattle at an angle of 45 degrees above his head and encourage him to roll over in both directions. Your baby has to roll over by a deliberate push of his body (through the shoulder or pelvis), and not because of accidental fall following the lifting of the head. Usually <a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-roll-over\">rolling over</a> from the back to the belly comes first and only after comes rolling from belly to the back. This is because today many babies do not spend much time on their belly; I saw this in both of my children, and most of my friends with kids will agree.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/milestones-for-your-3-to-6-month-old-baby-Baby-Communication-Milestones-e1629187619517.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Communication Milestones\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Talk to Me, Baby Communication Milestones</h2>\n<p>It is hard for me to imagine any parent to not <a href=\"/blog/baby-communication-tips/\">enjoy the language milestones</a>. I always felt a need to communicate to my kids, and when they started reciprocating, it was like an answer to prayer. I had some definite clues as to what they wanted, and because of this, I was quicker in getting them to stop crying or I could make them laugh more easily.</p>\n<p>Making sounds in response to stimulation (not just crying) can start as early as the third month; there are different sounds a baby makes for different things, and once you are able to tell which is which, life gets much easier. Or as easy as it can be with an infant around, anyway.</p>\n<p>To examine the development of communication and the ability to produce sounds, put your baby on his back, on a safe surface, or hold him in your lap – whichever is easier for making eye contact – and then make some gentle sounds. Give your baby time to listen to your voice and react to the sounds. Repeat this procedure two or three times, and see if they will mimic you or try to respond, but only after you have given them something to respond to.</p>\n<p>Laughing comes around four months, and comes after your baby has developed the ability to smile. Laughing is a fun milestone to check for, as you encourage your baby to laugh aloud through facial expressions, or tickling. Tickling worked best on my kids, but my husband was better at getting them to laugh than I was.</p>\n<p>When your baby begins to mumble or babble, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAmp4nWZ3_w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it is always a sign they are growing in the language skills</a>. To check the ability to produce sounds, all you need to do is encourage your baby to make sounds by talking, looking, and acting – and let him listen, and respond. Your baby should make vocal sounds and other noises, when playing, or when excited, or when he is not satisfied. Mumbling should include both consonant and vowel sounds. Sounds should be made with the lips (easier in prone position, while he is lying face down) and with the back of the mouth when it comes to guttural sounds (easier lying on his back.) This is one of the easier milestones to recognize, since there is a difference in the sounds depending on their position, and their mumbling tends to be strung together to make more words.</p>\n<h3>Milestones Conclusion</h3>\n<p>While the first three months of your baby’s life can seem overwhelming, once you make it through, you realize it was a lot, but your baby was well worth it. As your baby progresses through the three to six month old child development stages, you can begin to relax and enjoy your baby a bit more as you get to know him or her better.</p>\n<p><em><strong>How was your <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">baby development</a> at this stage?

    htmlContent: "<h1>What to do when your baby sucking does not stop ?</h1>\n<h2>Here’s what to do when your baby sucking dose’nt stop:</h2>\n<h3>Frequenly asked, short answers:</h3>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Spot signs of hunger</h2>\n<p>Our baby body does not lie and if he or she shows signs of hunger – he or she are really hungry. If you see previous signs of hunger, our baby may have experienced growth sprouts and or development milestones and he is in fact more hungry than usual. Increased hunger signs may be: Putting his hands in his mouth with intensively clenched fists, continuous drooling, and general discomfort and quenching. </p>\n<p>It is important that in situation like these, and <a href=\"/course/breast-feeding-secrets-2/\">when breastfeeding, you as a mom will also try to identify your baby’s satiety signs during breastfeeding</a>, any <a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">breastfeed</a>ing. Signs of satiety may be: a loose/flabby body, loose/flabby fingers and more. If you do not see any signs of satiety during breastfeeding, keep reading.</p>\n<h2>The amount of milk</h2>\n<p>If you spot signs of hunger in your baby and the need for <a href=\"/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-secretes/\">continuing to breastfeed for a long time and periods</a>, and there are no signs that your baby is satiety during breastfeeding, maybe your baby is not getting a sufficient amount of milk at each feeding. You should check the effectiveness of breastfeeding and the amount of milk. <a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">If breastfeeding is not effective</a>, due to reasons like ANKYLOGLOSSIA – Tongue-Tie and Lip-Tie related issues our baby will be sated for only short periods of time and often ask to nurse again and again.</p>\n<h2>Baby sucking: Spot signs of fatigue</h2>\n<p>If you see that your baby is unable to fall asleep on his own and needs the help of breastfeeding or sucking the nipple and you can recognize signs of fullness during breastfeeding, it is possible that your baby has reached a critical stage of fatigue where he or she will need help to fall asleep, this help is brought by breastfeeding.</p>\n<p>It is very important for you as a mom to <a href=\"/blog/5-steps-for-a-better-quitter-night-sleep/\">recognize the signs of fatigue in your baby early</a> and try to put him to sleep in a peaceful and relaxed atmosphere with gentle stroking, rocking and soothing him to sleep. It is possible and well encouraged to do this from the age of one week or two weeks, thus allowing your <a href=\"/0-3-months-baby\">newborn baby</a> to learn the process of falling asleep relaxed and comfortable from his first days and on words.</p>\n<p>Early signs of fatigue may be: moving his or her head from side to side and the inability to focus their view. If your baby reaches a critical stage of fatigue and you can spot it by his crying, making high sounds, hyperactivity, tears and laughter combined and more, it is important for you to understand that at this stage your baby needs all the possible help to fall asleep and breast milk can really help calm him down at this time. When you spot critical fatigue in your baby this is NOT the time for learning or teaching him.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/what-to-do-when-your-baby-does-not-stop-sucking-baby-sucking-does-not-stop-e1629186609981.jpg\" alt=\"baby sucking does not stop\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>NEW </strong>: <a href=\"/blog/breast-milk-benefits/\">10 unexpected ways breast milk is being used to improve health and wellness. Discover the surprising benefits of breast milk beyond feeding your baby</a> – read it here.</p>\n<h2>The need to poop</h2>\n<p>Many times our baby will want to breastfeed to help him poop. Our ring muscle systems in our body are interrelated, so our tiny baby will try to activate his muscles of the mouth and lips so his muscle system will help the poop go down and out of his system. This situation will not look like signs of hunger in our baby but as signs that he or she needs to poop. These signs can be: Sucking movements with the lips, licking his lips, rapid movements with his pelvis, and even stretching his legs back and forth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/newborn-tips-and-facts/\">If you recognize these signs in your baby</a>, you can hold your baby in the kneeling posture on your hands: When his back is to your chest and his legs are bent toward the abdomen.</p>\n<h2>Baby sucking: Teaching your baby to suck a pacifier</h2>\n<p>First thing first, not every baby’s jaw structure is suitable for a pacifier, so it’s important to test and try a variety of dummies and don’t quit after the first or second. Some babies who initially fail to take a pacifier because their jaw structure is not suitable for it at the present and they will start after they will grow up a bit and their jawline changes. It is possible that your baby’s jaw structure would work out just at the age when the pacifier is no longer relevant.</p>\n<p>It is very<a href=\"/blog/pacifiers-past-6-month/\"> important at the beginning to let your baby play with the pacifier and get used to it</a> at times when he or she are calm and relaxed and not hungry or tired. When you see that your baby has been playing and getting familiar with the pacifier in a relaxed way, then you can offer it to him in situations in which you recognize early signs of fatigue. Give him the pacifier in a relaxed and quiet atmosphere and as part of his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWJDOa55nT8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">falling asleep routine</a>.</p>\n<p>When you give your baby a pacifier for the first time, try to emulate sounds of sucking and the action needed. Babies and children learn from the simulation, they will try to imitate you and understand more easily the action that is needed.</p>\n<h3>Baby sucking Conclusion</h3>\n<p>You are not a human pacifier, and if this is the case you need to stop now and change this behavior. First recognize when your baby is hungry – if this is the case breastfeed, if this is not the case try different methods to let your baby relax and get some peace and tranquility for your baby and for you.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Do you have a special technic to get your baby to relax instead of breastfeeding?

What do I do if my child does not meet his or her milestones? Does that make me a bad mother, or does it mean my child will have problems? How can I help my son or daughter achieve his or her milestones?</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, God, what are my in-laws going to say if my child does not meet his or her milestones?</strong></p>\n<p>Thank goodness for logic. My doctor explained to me very easily milestones are just general expectations babies have around certain times in their lives; she stressed the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/index.html\" title=\"CDC Milestone Checklist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">developmental milestone</a>s, from week-to-week to month-to-month, from <a href=\"/0-3-months-baby\">newborn development</a> to <a href=\"/12-24-months-baby\">toddler development</a>, are just guidelines for every child. And when it comes down to it, every child is different. I relaxed quite a bit as she walked me through several examples. Even though I was not even four months along yet, I was comforted greatly by knowledge. There is nothing more calming in the face of “what if” and “what could be” than “what to expect” and “what do to if…happens.”</p>\n<p>Her tutorial was a needed reminder following the birth of my son, <a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">especially in the first three months of his life</a>. As a first-time mother, I wanted to make sure of two things: First, that my son was on par with his infant reflexes, and second, that I was being a good mommy by helping him to learn the reflexes he needed to know.</p>\n<h2>3 month old baby – The First Month is the Longest Month</h2>\n<p>The first month heralds much excitement in a mother. We have instantly dropped close, if not more, to ten pounds from giving birth, and we are getting acquainted with our little one. The baby’s development stages all start off with simple ways of getting to know you. Looking at your face, as his or her mother, is one of the first ones.</p>\n<p>Your baby should be able to look up at you as the first month continues; you can see this as late as the third month, however, so if your child does not look up at your face until then, it is okay. He might just be more interested in something else; my son really liked to watch his mobile when he was getting his diaper changed or when I would put him down in his crib.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get your baby to make eye contact with you. To check eye contact, hold your baby at arm’s length in front of your face, or lay him on his back at a similar distance. I would put my son and my daughter on the floor on a blanket, and then lean over them. Focus your gaze into your baby’s face. Your baby should be able to make eye contact with you here. I would often talk to them like this, to get them not only to look at me, but get them to start babbling. It was just so cute; I wanted to see if they would “talk back” to me.</p>\n<p>In the same line, one of the next baby milestones is how they react to loud sounds or intensify and ceases activities. This helps test their hearing abilities, and it is simple; all you need to do is check the baby’s reaction to loud sounds. For this one, it really is a learning process; the babies don’t know how to react to them at first. I had to learn that myself; when my daughter didn’t react to my dog barking at first, I felt the worry creeping in. But later on, she started laughing at the dog when it would bark, so that might explain why she didn’t jump or flinch or cry right away.</p>\n<p>To check this more objectively, lay your baby on his back on a flat surface. Clap your hands; make sure you hold them where your baby cannot see. Your baby should respond to loud noises, either stopping his activity, or intensifying his facial expressions, movements of limbs, or sucking. At one month, the baby might not move around a lot to see where the sound is coming from; at three months, he might be more comfortable moving his head towards the sound.</p>\n<p>On a more physical level, in the first month, a baby is expected to begin making symmetrical movements in his or her body. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IWkmBGJ9EaA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What this means is your baby’s movements should be similar, though not identical, for each of her arms and legs</a>. To check the symmetry of the baby’s movement, you will need to lay your baby on her back and watch her movements.</p>\n<p>Speed and strength should be relatively similar in all limbs, so that there is no arm or leg that your baby has significantly less actions than the others’ movements.</p>\n<p>These are some of the first key milestones. One of my favorite things to keep in mind in life and with kids is that the more you try to do, the less you will get done. If you can check those four milestones on your own, and feel comfortable (or at least not uncomfortable) doing them, that is a good start.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/how-to-work-with-0-3-month-old-babies-on-their-milestones-3-month-old-baby-on-back-scaled-e1629106328225.jpg\" alt=\"3 month old baby on back\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>How to Work with 3 Month Old baby on their Milestones The Second Month Starts</h2>\n<p>As the first month rolls into the second, the physical movements start to become more pronounced. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IWkmBGJ9EaA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You will see your baby start to move more often, and with more confidence</a>. I once told my husband after the second month, I was used to the baby’s weight and it was much easier to hold them on my end; for both of mine, the power they were comfortable wielding with their arms and legs made me more comfortable.</p>\n<p>During the second month, if your child has begun to look at your face, you might also see him start to use his eyes to follow a moving object. I saw this pretty early with my son; we had two cats at our house, and just looking at him, I could tell he wanted to know what they were. I would pull them down and let him “pet” them. He would begin to watch them as they wrangled themselves free. By the time my daughter came, the cats were used to having a baby around, so they came up to her on their own.</p>\n<p>To check the ability to make eye contact and facial movements in motion, or follow an object in motion, you can lay your baby on his back or hold him in your lap in front of another person. When the baby is looking, move your face left and right (just a few inches each way) through the center of his vision, at a distance of about 20-30 inches from your baby’s eyes. Since you are his mother (or father) and he is familiar with you, you can see if he will follow your face.</p>\n<p>You can also do this step with an object such as a rattle or another toy, or even a cat like I did. The key for the first couple of tries is not to accompany the tests with voices or sounds. Your baby should be able to follow the face of the parent or the object at a pace of the other person, or the object he held before his eyes.</p>\n<h2>3 month old baby, month milestones Third Month and Fourth Development </h2>\n<p>Since babies are all different, their measurements, <a href=\"/blog/infant-growth-spurts-what-does-it-mean-what-to-do/\">both on the infant growth charts and the baby development milestones</a>, might be all different, no matter how many kids you have (although some might be the same). You should try to see the baby stages with each child as a continuation; each day they are getting older and as they learn something new, they can still do the old moves, too.</p>\n<p>This is seen in getting your child to follow your face as you move across his line of vision. This is similar to the previous milestone, which is the start on helping him develop the next developmental milestone; this is the milestone where he follows movements across the midline of his vision.</p>\n<p>To check your baby’s ability to make eye contact and the ability to track face movement or an object in motion, get him ready to watch you. You can do this by laying him on his back or sitting up in someone else’s lap. When your baby moves his eyes up, move your head to the left and right through the center (this time, about a foot each way) about 20-30 inches away from your baby’s eyes. You can repeat the action with any object or toy.</p>\n<p>Like the previous milestone check, there should not be any noise around to help your baby be able to focus. Your baby should be able to follow our face or the object at your own pace, or the object you hold before his eyes.</p>\n<p>Remember that this step is more complicated for your child than the previous one; as a result, while this milestone shows up as early as the second month; it might not come until the fourth month. I have learned several times over that some babies just don’t even reach some of the baby stages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/pre-crawling/\">My son started crawling at five months</a>, and was walking by ten months; my daughter, watching her brother play and run around with our dog, didn’t start crawling until eight months, and she wanted to walk so badly her crawling was neglected. But even though she wants to walk more than she likes crawling, there’s one milestone that was my favorite with both of my children: smiling.</p>\n<p>If your <a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-smile\">baby smile</a>s in response to social stimulation, you have reached another milestone, and this is a happy one. Talk to your baby, or tease her with a nice touch to the face or chin, to examine if your baby is smiling and responding to this stimulus.</p>\n<p>I loved it when both of my kids started smiling; it was just a magical moment. I could see they were happy, and furthermore, when they began to smile, I could see it as a sign as to what made them happy. Seeing them grin at my husband, or smile as they see me headed their way, or how happy they looked when would see the dog or cats, would just fill me with such joy.</p>\n<p>While I have gone over some of the earlier milestones – the eye contact, tracking, similar movements, and smiling – I want to assure you any of these could pop up at any time during the first three months, and some even into the fourth month. It is important to check the milestones to make sure your baby is developing well and keeping up on his or her progress.</p>\n<p>If your child does not do any of these, it should be a sign to take them to the doctor to get them checked out. The important thing here is just that you are paying attention to your child, and you know your child well enough to see if something is wrong or something needs to be checked out by a specialist.</p>\n<p>As your baby grows, you as their parent should be able to see if something is off. Each child has his or her own personality as well as level of ability. I knew of one little girl who was born around the same time as my son, and she did not smile very often. She started smiling more frequently later on as a toddler, but as a baby, she was just very serious. There wasn’t anything wrong with her; it was all personality.</p>\n<h2>Importent Reminders</h2>\n<p>As a parent, you should be able to see the milestones. Before the baby comes, it seems like a lot of work to watch for them or to help the babies develop the skills and abilities. <a href=\"/blog/baby-milestones-month-by-month-for-the-first-year/\">But in the first three months, your world bends and surrounds your child</a>. You love your baby, and you will be watching him or her constantly. You will want to get to know them and help them develop. The first month of both my children’s lives were very long, but they were also very short; once I had them, I fell in love with them, and after you fall, there is a blissful sort of recovery period as you realign your priorities. Each minute was precious and celebrated, but it all seemed very short by the time the fourth month started.</p>\n<h2>3 month old baby Conclusiona</h2>\n<p>The first three months of your child’s life are filled with learning, and learning about each other. While the baby stages and development milestones might seem stressful, you will have the best aid in getting through them: the unconditional, powerful love of your child.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Which 0-3 milestones did you try?

    htmlContent: "<blockquote><p>Milestones are a great way to monitor your baby’s progression, incorporate ways to improve their age-appropriate skills into every day play, and feel prepared for each new stage as your baby reaches it. While it is easy to compare in a competitive manner with others about whose baby has reached a certain milestone earliest, it’s better to just enjoy each individual child’s pace, and not become anxious or possibly make others worried about how quickly each milestone is reached.</p></blockquote>\n<h1>What to expect the first year.</h1>\n<p>It is truly amazing how many basic skills we master as an infant that allow us to go about our days in a functional manner as adults. These skills can be grouped into different categories, for the sake of tracking developmental progress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gross motor skills – these include more generalized physical movements.</li>\n<li>Fine motor skills – these include more specific physical movements, mostly with the hands</li>\n<li>Social development – this includes interactions with other people</li>\n<li>Language development – this includes not only verbal skills, but also thought processes such as problem-solving skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"/blog/baby-milestones-month-by-month-for-the-first-year/\">each baby will develop at his or her own pace, to some degree</a>. Sometimes a baby will be ahead in one area, right at the milestone age for another area, and behind in another area, all at once, and that’s perfectly normal. If a child is missing a milestone for an extended period of time, or if the doctor and parents are concerned about missed milestones, an evaluation can be done to see what interventions could benefit him or her.</p>\n<p>Some of these interventions include participating in speech therapy, occupational therapy, and <a href=\"https://www.apta.org/your-health/conditions-treatments/pediatrics\" title=\"APTA Pediatric Resources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">physical therapy</a> – and often, there are many things the parents or caregivers can do at home first to help their baby continue to develop. The key isn’t necessarily an exact date that your baby should be able to do something by, but rather, a steady forward progression of skills.</p>\n<p>That being said, parents and teachers are often the first to see the signs of a need for intervention, by intuition or by looking at the time frames around milestones. This is because they are the ones who are spending large amounts of time with the child, and may notice patterns that a short doctor’s visit would not reveal.</p>\n<p>Of course, the more you interact with your baby in general, by talking with her, playing with toys with her, singing to her, making different facial expressions for her, reading with her, holding her, allowing her to experience new things, and providing enough down time at home where she’s not confined to just the crib or swing, will allow her to develop skills naturally.</p>\n<h2>One Month Milestones –</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/0-3-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">Around one month, your newborn baby will be lifting his head up from your chest when you hold him</a>, or from the ground when participating in floor play (often called “<a href=\"/blog/tummy-time\">tummy time</a>”). He should be able to move his head to either side when on his belly. Of course, he should be attended at all times when on his stomach at this age, because he may get stuck at times; he will get tired, maybe only after a few seconds. Make sure tummy time is done on a smooth, flat, but comfortable surface – foam mats can be used to convert an area of harder flooring, or even over carpet.</p>\n<p>Also around this time, your baby will start noticing things in close range (8-12 inches away). Unlike her ever changing and improving vision, she is born with her full hearing, and may startle at sounds like a door closing, another baby crying, etc. She probably recognizes immediate family members’ voices and is comforted by their conversations.</p>\n<p>At this stage, he will probably notice toys that have faces. He will possibly notice things that contrast a lot, such as dark curtains against a light wall. He may like your black and white striped shirt, and there’s a reason – he still sees mostly black and white at this age.</p>\n<h2>What to expect the first year – Two Month Milestones –</h2>\n<p>One of the most prominent two month markers is the start of your baby making noises such as “cooing” or “gurgling.”She will likely make an “ahhh” sound first. At this point, she’s as likely talking to the bright lights on the ceiling as she is to her doll or you, but even so, you will get to enjoy her new antics during her calmer play times.</p>\n<p>As for physical development, you will notice your baby has less jerky arm and leg movements, and should move all of his limbs about the same amount over a period of time. His fists will probably open and close, and grasp at your finger when you place it near his hand. He may touch his own face or clasp his own hands.</p>\n<h2>Three Month Milestones –</h2>\n<p>While your baby has probably been giving you “sleepy smiles” for a while now, she will <a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-smile/\">start to smile in response to things you say or do</a>, or other stimuli. She will follow objects as they move across her range of view, such as a bottle or toy. She may even take a swing at a dangling toy!</p>\n<p>Around this time, your newborn will lift not only his head, but also start to raise his body up during tummy time. Between now and six months, your baby will learn how to roll over. Usually, he will first learn to roll from his stomach to his back, and later, from his back to his stomach.</p>\n<p>While she previously may have ignored many noises in her sleepy, newborn state, she may now investigate sudden noises, especially loud ones. Your baby will also recognize objects she has seen before, such as toys or books.</p>\n<h2>Four Month Milestones –</h2>\n<p>Your baby will push her body up with her hands during tummy time, and push her legs against the ground if you hold her in a standing position. By this time, your baby should have really good head control. She will begin to reach for things around her and grasp them in a more coordinated fashion.</p>\n<p>He will “talk back” to you when you talk to him, in the form of coos as well as imitations of your speech. Also, you may experience the joyous sound of your baby’s laughter at this time, so bring on the silly faces and noises.</p>\n<p>This is around the age <a href=\"/courses/babypillars-sleep-plan/\">most babies are able to sleep through the night,</a> much to your relief, exhausted parents!</p>\n<h2>Five Month Milestones –</h2>\n<p>If not earlier, around five months your baby will be able to roll over in both directions. He will be conscious of his own hands and feet, and may even spend long periods of time studying them.</p>\n<p>Your baby will be Interested in new sounds, and recognize her own name at this age. She may engage in blowing bubbles with her mouth, as she explores all she can do with her tongue and lips.</p>\n<p>He will likely notice and enjoy different bright colors at this time, and express interest in especially colorful toys. Your baby will develop a sense of object permanence around this time (realizing that things still exist even when they can no longer see them – this is why your baby will be surprised time and again during a game of peek-a-boo!).</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/baby-milestones-month-by-month-for-the-first-year-What-to-expect-the-first-year-twins-scaled-e1629104537705.jpg\" alt=\"What to expect the first year twins\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>What to expect the first year – Six Month Milestones –</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/courses/3-6-months-milestone-mastery-course/\">Your baby will be able to sit, although he may still need some support</a>. During floor time, he may lunge like he is going to crawl. He may also scoot (some babies skip crawling and go straight to walking), or “army crawl,” that is, dragging himself along as low as possible to the ground, with just his arms.</p>\n<p>Everything will go into the mouth at this age – your baby will be able to reach for an object and bring it to his mouth after retrieving it.</p>\n<p>Often, doctors recommend solid foods are introduced at 6 months and even sooner, or whenever your baby is able to sit up. The introduction of solids will help in developing the skills your baby needs to feed himself, as well as get your baby used to different textures and tastes.</p>\n<h2>Seven Month Milestones –</h2>\n<p>Your baby will be able to sit without support. While sitting, she will probably display several new skills, such as being able to pull a toy toward herself using a sweeping motion of her arm. That would be more of a gross motor skill that you can expect her to master at this age; a fine motor skill she will develop at this age is the ability to pass a toy from one hand to another.</p>\n<h1>Eight Month Milestones –</h1>\n<p>Your baby may start to say dada and mama at this age – but don’t be surprised if you are both referred to by the same name, or both names, for a while!</p>\n<p>If your baby is a crawler, he should be a professional at this point, getting around quite quickly. He might quite possibly start experimenting with pulling up on furniture, even if walking is still a ways away.</p>\n<p>Another fun skill that will be developed at this age in the language development area is that your baby will begin to point at things, and attempt to communicate through some gestures. Some parents choose to teach their children a few simple signs based on American Sign Language at this stage, to help them communicate when they are hungry, all done, want to play, etc. This way, they can communicate before they can speak words, resulting in potentially less frustration.</p>\n<h2>What to expect the first year – Nine Month Milestones –</h2>\n<p>Nothing within reach is safe anymore! Your baby will be able to bang things together, throw things, and stand – though most likely only while supported. He may walk around using furniture to hold him up, which is called “cruising.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/5f_k8gR9sgw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Your baby’s hands are developing more fine motor skills around this age </a>– she may eat finger foods off her high chair tray, and will use the “pincer grasp” to accomplish manipulating small pieces of food and objects – that is, her thumb and forefinger.</p>\n<p>She may also wave good-bye, which she also associates with the meaning of the words bye-bye (that is, someone, or herself, leaving).</p>\n<p>Socially, at this age babies often have stranger anxiety – anyone unfamiliar can be deeply unsettling. Your baby will outgrow any extreme reaction a little later on.</p>\n<h2>Ten Month Milestones –</h2>\n<p>Finally, when your baby calls out “Mama!”now, she might actually be referring to you specifically! She should also understand the word, “No,” at this point, to some degree – thankfully, she probably won’t be saying that for a little while longer.</p>\n<p>Your baby will start to stack toys as he plays, so get out the blocks!</p>\n<p>A game that you might not like this age for involves dropping objects repeatedly from a shopping cart, high chair, or over a baby gate, to see what happens, and what you will do. A ten month old finds reactions, and consequences, very interesting.</p>\n<h2>Eleven Month Milestones –</h2>\n<p>Often a skill mastered around this age is the ability to drink from a cup (although breast fed babies may not be introduced to this quite yet, as they don’t even need extra water until past twelve months). You can say bye-bye to bottles very soon!</p>\n<p>Your baby should be able to stand all by herself – although possibly only briefly. While playing, you will observe your baby has the ability to puts toys inside containers, and may enjoy learning “in and out.” A favorite game at this age may be pat-a-cake.</p>\n<p>Your baby will understand simple commands, such as, “Take this to Daddy,” or “Give me your cup,” or “Let’s go outside.” Of course, he may not always react the way you intend for him to.</p>\n<h2>Twelve Month Milestones –</h2>\n<p>You may find your baby imitating everything you do, from talking on the phone, to making dinner, to other activities. A play kitchen may be a great first birthday present!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-start-walking/\">His first steps may be taken around this time, although many babies wait a few more months </a>– or he may have been walking for a couple of months already! The norm here is 9-14 months. Another skill he may master around this time will be stooping from a standing position, without falling all of the way down. This takes some balance!</p>\n<p>A few more words may enter his vocabulary, as he imitates you and observes as you point out the names of things around you.</p>\n<p>She may scribble on paper or books with a crayon, although coloring in the lines will not be a remote thought until much later.</p>\n<h2>What to expect the first year – Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Milestones are a great way to monitor your baby’s progression, incorporate ways to improve their age-appropriate skills into every day play, and feel prepared for each new stage as your baby reaches it. While it is easy to compare in a competitive manner with others about whose baby has reached a certain milestone earliest, it’s better to just enjoy each individual child’s pace, and not become anxious or possibly make others worried about how quickly each milestone is reached. As your baby’s motor skills, social skills, and language skills develop, you will likely find great joy and pride in their growth – don’t forget to update the baby calendar or the <a href=\"/books\">baby book</a>!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Did your baby pass all these milestones?

    htmlContent: "<h1>Infant Growth Spurts, What does it mean? What to do?</h1>\n<p>Just when you think your baby has some sort of natural pattern of sleeping, waking, and eating – you may find yourself exhausted by a feeding marathon, or, more blissfully, you may find he has slept extra hours during the last day or so. Why the sudden break of patterns? Your baby may be undergoing an infant growth spurts!</p>\n<h2>Infant Growth Spurts, frequently asked:</h2>\n<h2>Infant Growth Spurts, What does it mean? What to do?</h2>\n<p>While you should <a href=\"/blog/newborn-tips-and-facts/\">track a newborn’s patterns more closely with an infant growth spurts chart</a>, to ensure that he is not getting dehydrated or otherwise in need of urgent care, sleeping an extra hour or two more before the next feeding may be just what your baby needs to grow and it is one on our infant <a href=\"/blog/infant-growth-spurts-the-ultimate-guide\">growth spurt</a>s symptoms. (Of course, if your baby seems lethargic, or you are otherwise concerned, consult your doctor immediately. Also, unlike teething, a fever does not normally accompany a growth spurt, so this would be a clue that something else is going on.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/g5qvYw-3-G0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Infant growth spurts occur about 5 or 6 times before baby’s first birthday, and each growth spurt lasts a couple of days</a>. Somewhere between 10 days and two weeks, the first one will occur. Other growth spurts occur around 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months – but you will definitely recognize a growth spurt by your baby’s changes in behavior, even if he is on his own unique schedule.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, in between growth spurts, your baby may feed more frequently for a day or two, without much noticeable gain – and these are called feeding spurts. But with a growth spurt, your baby may appear to outgrow her clothes and diapers overnight. Growth spurts usually have a period of eating more, and <a href=\"/courses/babypillars-sleep-plan/\">a period of changed sleep patterns</a>. Other signs include restlessness, particularly clingy behavior, and dissatisfaction after feedings.</p>\n<p>During sleep, the body produces a special hormone that helps babies grow. This hormone is simply called the human growth hormone (HGH). Your baby needs food and rest to grow – if you are wondering what you can do during a growth spurt to help your baby, follow her natural cues, and allow her to sleep when she needs to sleep, and eat when she is hungry. By the first growth spurt, you’ll probably know her feeding cues; if you’re thinking, you can’t possibly be hungry still / again, you may just be surprised! It won’t last for forever, though.</p>\n<p>Especially if you are <a href=\"/blog/breastfeeding-tips\">breastfeed</a>ing, the first few growth spurts can be extremely taxing physically for a mother and can lead to exhaustion both emotionally and physically for the new mom who tries to do everything herself. Allow yourself some grace! You’re still figuring all of this out, and it is perfectly normal to ask others around you to help out by giving you a break or taking care of a few tasks. You may also need more fluids, an extra snack, and to take advantage of napping while your baby is sleeping. Don’t be afraid to guard your time and communicate your needs.</p>\n<h3>Baby growth spurts more frequntly asked:</h3>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/infant-growth-spurts-what-does-it-mean-what-to-do-infant-growth-spurts-what-are-they-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"infant growth spurts what are they\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h3>How much does a baby grow in the first month/year?</h3>\n<p>You might be wondering exactly <a href=\"/blog/baby-milestones-month-by-month-for-the-first-year/\">how much your baby might grow in first year of her life</a>. Although each child will grow at her own rate, she could increase in length about 10 inches, and gain up to 3 times her birth weight. Growth charts are a tool used to track your child’s development, so that any issues can be addressed in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>Your child’s development, even during a growth spurt, should fairly closely follow a particular line, or percentile. A percentile tells you how your child measures compared to 100 other children his age. If you told 100 children to line up tallest to shortest, and your child was at the 45th percentile, then he would stand right after kid number 45 – he would be taller than 45 kids, and shorter than 55. Usually, length, weight, and head circumference are measured for infants. BMI is not used until the child is over 2 years of age.</p>\n<p>Some breastfeeding mothers become worried that their supply is too low, and attribute their baby’s fussiness, associated with growth spurts, to their baby’s not getting enough milk. If this is your case, know that supplementing can actually interfere with your supply. To further relieve your fear of not making enough milk, keep in mind that more frequent feedings will actually increase your supply, as your body is being told to make more milk, more often.</p>\n<p>If you’re <a href=\"/0-3-months-baby\">newborn baby</a> is fussy after a feeding, try swaddling her, and putting her in a swing, or, for any age, wearing her. Some babies will want to suck on something to soothe themselves, as well. If she calms down, she probably got enough to eat; hunger would overpower these soothing methods. Another good test that may be an option is to go for a walk with your baby after a feeding if she is particularly fussy. If she falls asleep, she was satisfied – and you get the benefit of a little fresh air and exercise.</p>\n<p>Wearing your baby during a growth spurt may allow you to nurse more frequently while still being free to take care of yourself, if helping hands are limited, or you have multiple young children. This also keeps your baby feeling secure and reassured if they are not sleeping well during this part of the growth spurt.</p>\n<p>Of course, another reassuring fact is if your baby is producing enough wet and soiled diapers, then he is getting enough milk. (Four or more bowel movements and six or more wet per 24 hours is normal for a breastfed baby.) During a growth spurt, you will most likely see more diapers than your baby’s average, as more milk is going through his system, whether formula fed or breastfed. It is potentially helpful to track feedings, diaper changings, etc. on a chart. There are several printable ones available online, as well as apps for smart phones that you may download for free.</p>\n<h3>Infant growth spurts our conclusion</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/q-a-3-month-growth-spurts/\">Growth spurts can be a trying period of time for parents</a>, but armed with information, patience, and most importantly – love – these time periods will pass, and your healthy baby will be him- or herself again!</p>\n<p>For more video tutorials regarding infant milestones during the <a href=\"/0-3-months-baby/\">0-3 month age range please click here</a>, or <a href=\"/3-6-months-baby/\">3-6 month age range please click here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Which infant growth spurts did you observed in your baby?

    htmlContent: "<blockquote><p><a href=\"/blog/baby-crawling-guide\">Baby crawl</a>ing is defined as any progression either behind or forward. Crawling is the first step that a baby takes to move on its own. It is the method of moving with the help of the hands and his knees. Both hands and knees are key elements to crawling as they hels to move front and back and also balances the entire body from falling.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Our baby first learns to crawl on his own when he is experiences a bit of moving without the help of others. Our baby can move forward or backward with the help of his own hands and knees. The hands keep him balance his entire body and the knees help him to move around in the space. The other important attribute of crawling is it helps our baby strengthening his muscles to be able to make him strong enough to walk in future milestones.</p></blockquote>\n<h1>The Development of Baby Crawling</h1>\n<p>It is observed that most of the babies started learning to crawl in the age of 7 months. <a href=\"/blog/pre-crawling/\">Some babies start crawling as late as 10 month to actually start crawling</a>. It may change depending on the growth of the child and how quickly a baby learns to crawl. Other forms of movement includes rolling, scooting, slithering. But it is the first step for a baby towards learning experience of moving around the open space.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/baby-crawling-guide/\">Some babies may not crawl at all; instead move directly to pulling, standing, cruising, and walking</a>. Some parents tend to be worried about their babies if they do not crawl but it is a matter of evidence that clarifies that it is just a mere incident and not worrying fact at all. Our baby is likely to crawl when he or she becomes capable of sitting without support from others.</p>\n<p>At this stage, our baby is strong enough to make its head steady. Our baby hands and knees are muscular enough to move forward and backward. At the time of crawling, our babies look around to find something they are looking for such as toys, equipment or anything of their interest.</p>\n<p>After 4 months of their birth, babies started crawling and it takes almost another 3-4 months to <a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-start-walking\">start walking</a> around without the help of others. When a baby becomes perfect in its movement through crawling, it uses an arm and a leg to move around rather than using two hands. Gradually, it starts learning how to be sit for a crawling position.</p>\n<h2>The Next Steps of Crawling</h2>\n<p>When our baby becomes mastered at crawling, <a href=\"/blog/when-do-babies-start-walking/\">the next thing that matters the most for our baby is to learn how to walk around</a>. After that he or she pulls up for reaching to table, chair, and any object in which it can stand with. Once it grasps the knowledge of standing on her feet completely, it has gained confidence of moving around through crawling, walking, leaping, jumping, running etc.</p>\n<h2>The Parents’ Role</h2>\n<p>Parents’ roles are very important when babies try to learn how to crawl. It is imperative that we as parents’ should give our baby enough open space for crawling. Parents should give them some <a href=\"/blog/tummy-time\">tummy time</a> for learning. Physical demonstration of crawling is another very important thing as babies try to imitate others behavior. Parents or any elderly person must give some time with the baby for playing with them. Mother should use techniques to improve the muscles of the babies so that they can crawl.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8804CPcyF2c\">The best way to improve crawling is to push them forward to reaching or grabbing things</a>. The American Academy of <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/\" title=\"AAP HealthyChildren.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pediatric</a>s (AAP) suggested that pillows, boxes, and sofa cushions are the objects that can be used to create obstacles. Our baby has to navigate these obstacles in order to get around smoothly. These navigation movements will build confidence, agility and speed of our baby to learn quickly. </p>\n<p>We as parents’ should also keep in mind that a crawling baby is prone to accidents. Therefore, it is our duty to make the house childproofed especially the stairs gateway. The stairs should be kept away from the reach or the babies should continuously observe in order to avoid any accident before they completely learn how to walk.</p>\n<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also suggested that our babies need not to be wore footwear until they properly learn how to walk. Another role of the parents is to keep practicing light exercises with their babies which are helpful for them to <a href=\"/babypillars-24-bundle\">learn more</a> quickly.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"/blog/baby-crawling-a-step-forward-to-learning-baby-crawling-e1628846057923.jpg\" alt=\"baby crawling 3 month\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<h2>Matter of Concern</h2>\n<p>Babies usually are very imitative in nature. They do what others do. Therefore, it is an imperative task for us as parents not to engage in such activities which are harmful. <a href=\"/courses/\">They usually learn to develop various skills and techniques at different stages of their growth</a>. The matter of concern for the parents is when they start learning to crawl, accidents may take place.</p>\n<p>Harmful chemicals, scissors, computer peripherals, electronic goods, electric wires are especially prone to such accidents. Moreover, if the house is multi-storied, then the stairs are also subject to accidents to children given that the child is unable to walk on its own.</p>\n<p>Other matter of concern for the parents is for the babies who have not shown any progress of crawling at all even after the age of 12 months. The parents then need to consult with the physician to try to identify the fact. Moreover, <a href=\"/blog/premature-baby-care/\">premature babies are unlikely to behave normally</a>, which means they start to crawl a bit later in their growth.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Babies are very sophisticated in nature. It is not always the fact that they will start crawling from a particular age of their life cycle rather it is a subjective matter. Some babies start crawling a bit earlier and some starts a bit later. It is not universally true each child will have the same level of stamina, strength and effort.</p>\n<p>It may vary from one to another but certainly it is a method that children learn at some stages of their life cycle. In fact, it is one of the most important steps for most of the children to develop to learn how to walk without the help of others.</p>\n<p>When did your baby started to crawl? Did you help with your his or her crawling? Let us know below…</p>",
